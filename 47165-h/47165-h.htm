<h2 class="p4">PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="p2">Visiting a Life Saving Station on our coast, and
passing a night there, I became deeply interested
in the work of the hardy crew. I have examined
with an absorbing gratification various reports of
the Service. We may fittingly have a national
pride in the intent and achievement of this department.
The element of the heroic runs through
and makes luminous the pages of what on the face
are only ordinary governmental reports. May the
accompanying story interest our young people in
the work of the Life Saving Service. While they
accept, make theirs, and build upon the principles
of honesty, reverence, and temperance laid down
in this story, may they extend their sympathy and
prayers also to the brave men who watch the sea
while we are sleeping, and whose generous daring
may well provoke us to courage and self&ndash;sacrifice
in other spheres.</p>

<p class="pch">THE MAN ON THE STEEPLE.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;oh, grandfather! There’s&mdash;that&mdash;man&mdash;on
the&mdash;steeple&mdash;and he&mdash;can’t&mdash;get&mdash;down!”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, he can! He’s got a ladder!”
said the old boat&ndash;builder, Zebulon Smith, looking
up from the boat he had partly framed,
and addressing his grandson, who had run excitedly
into the shop and was now making
an almost breathless appeal.</p>

<p>“No, he&mdash;hasn’t;&mdash;he dropped&mdash;it!”</p>

<p>“Ladder dropped from the steeple?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;gone&mdash;all&mdash;all&mdash;to smash!”</p>

<p>“You don’t say, Cyrus!”</p>

<p>Feeling it might be the man who had come
down thus abruptly, and “gone all to smash,”
the boat&ndash;builder ran outdoors and gave a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
hasty look up at the steeple. He breathed
more easily when he saw the man far up the
steeple, clinging to a ball that supported the
vane. The steeple, though, was bare of any ladder,
for this lay in fragments on the ground.</p>

<p>“That is interestin’!” exclaimed the boat&ndash;builder.</p>

<p>Of course it was. Is it not exceedingly interesting,
the situation of a man on the steeple
of a church, without ladders, rope, or staging,
that may have taken him there? What if he
grow dizzy and&mdash;but who likes to think of the
consequences of such dizziness? Let me tell
how this man got there, and why there.</p>

<p>Zebulon Smith lived near the church, and
was its sexton. Besides the church, he had
no neighbor for three quarters of a mile. A
stranger called at the boat&ndash;shop one day, and
inquired the price of Zebulon’s wares. He
added, “I b’long to a life savin’ station crew,
and am interested in that thing, you know.”</p>

<p>“The station beyond us?”</p>

<p>“Ezackly! And see here! Don’t you want
somebody to fix your vane on the steeple of the
church, for I s’pose you go there. I’m used
to climbin’. I have been a sailor.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I go there. I’m the saxton. That
vane does need fixin’; but I can’t seem to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
at it. It’s fearfully twisted. I s’pose you’d
want suthin for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t ask much. I won’t ask
nothin’, if I don’t fix it.”</p>

<p>“All right. Cyrus, you get the ladder back
of the shop.”</p>

<p>Cyrus was a boy of sixteen, on a day’s visit
to his grandparents, and he had met there by
appointment a boy living in another direction
and a good half&ndash;hour’s walk away, Walter
Plympton, the hero of our story. The two boys
were interested in archery, and had brought
their apparatus to this accepted meeting&ndash;ground
for a trial of skill. They suspended shooting
when they knew the church&ndash;steeple was to be
climbed, and carried the ladder across the road
to the little white church on the edge of a grove
of tall pines that at every touch of the wind
stirred and murmured softly, musically, in response,
as if an orchestra were hidden away in
their spreading, fan&ndash;like branches. Zebulon
and his assistant mounted the stairs leading to
the belfry. There was a little railing outside
the belfry, and planting his ladder inside this
railing, the stranger climbed up to another railing
surrounding the base of the steeple. Here
he pulled up his ladder, and planted it now
against the steeple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“I shan’t want you any longer,” called out
the stranger. “If you’re busy, you can go
back. I can manage.”</p>

<p>“Got your hammer?” asked Zebulon.</p>

<p>“Yes, the one you lent me. I’ll knock that
vane into shape.”</p>

<p>The boat&ndash;builder was indeed anxious to resume
his work, and he now returned to his shop.
The man from the life saving station had planted
his ladder so that its summit rested between
two projections of the wood&ndash;work of the steeple,
that promised to firmly hold it in position. He
then climbed his ladder, and from the topmost
round he could reach a gilded ball beneath the
vane. He had planned to draw himself up to
the ball, sit astride this gilded throne in the air,
there swing his hammer like a king flourishing
his scepter, and knock that rebellious vane into
an attitude of obedience. Alas, our best expectations
sometimes fail us! Was not that
ladder an old one? How could it help growing
old, when its owner, Zebulon, was growing old
himself, and complained of rheumatism in his
joints? Rheumatism! That must have been
the trouble with the topmost round of the ladder.
But who really expects that an old ladder
will give way to&ndash;day? It may to&ndash;morrow; but
it has served so many years, it will certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
not fail us this one day. But, the day had come
when that ladder was bound to give way. Zebulon
did not anticipate it, or he would never
have assigned it to any steeple&ndash;duty. The
stranger of course was not looking for it. The
ladder kept its own secret however, and having,
made up its mind to break that very day and
hour, when the man grasped the ball above and
springing violently gave a corresponding push
to the ladder&ndash;round, it broke out into open rebellion.
It cracked, split, parted hopelessly!
That was not all. The ladder was jarred and
pushed out of position, and as the man went up,
and seated himself upon the ball, the ladder
went down and took a position on the ground!
As the ladder struck, various rheumatic joints
parted, and this old servant of the sexton
lay there at the foot of the church&ndash;tower in
fragments.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” exclaimed the man on the ball.
“That’s a poser!”</p>

<p>He thought a moment.</p>

<p>“Well,” he exclaimed philosophically, “I’ll
do what I came here for!”</p>

<p>Swinging his hammer, he knocked the vane
into proper shape. Zebulon heard the rapping
of the hammer, as orderly and musical as the
sound of any hammer strokes down on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
ground. He was surprised when he was summoned
to see the hammerer up in the air and
the broken ladder on the ground.</p>

<p>“Oh, Zebulon!” shrieked a voice. “Git a
ladder! Why don’t ye?”</p>

<p>“That’s Nancy!” he said to himself.</p>

<p>Yes, after this voice came a woman, and Zebulon’s
wife, rushing up to his side, put her hands
up to her eyes to fence off the sunlight, and
then looked at the occupant of that gilt ball on
the church&ndash;steeple.</p>

<p>“Git a ladder?” the old sexton murmured.
“Where?”</p>

<p>Yes, where? There was no other about the
premises, and to visit a neighbor for that purpose
would use up a half&ndash;hour, and in the meantime
what if&mdash;a person does not like to think
what might happen.</p>

<p>“Oh dear, Zebulon! What did you let him
go up for?” asked his wife.</p>

<p>“If&mdash;if&mdash;you had asked that question afore
he went up, there would have been some sense
to it. He wanted to go,” replied the old sexton
impatiently. “The thing to do now, is to git
him down.”</p>

<p>“Git him down! What if he should come
down whether he wants to or not? What if he
gits dizzy? Oh my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>!”</p>

<p>“You don’t ketch me jest a lookin’ at
him. I’m a goin’ to bring a ladder, find it
somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Zebulon! Hark, boys!”</p>

<p>The boat&ndash;builder and the two young archers,
thus addressed by Nancy, now listened in silence,
and at the same time looked up. There
they all stood, with upturned faces, and the
man above called down to them:</p>

<p>“Sho&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;t! Send&mdash;a&mdash;string&mdash;g!”</p>

<p>As he thus called, his hands let go their hold
upon the rod that bore the vane, and clinging
with his feet alone, he went through the motions
of one shooting an arrow from a bow.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;oh!” shrieked Nancy. “He’s beginnin’
to fall.”</p>

<p>With a horrified expression of countenance,
she turned away and faced the other side of the
road.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” cried Walter Plympton. “He is
not falling. He is making believe shoot. I see
what he wants.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Zebulon.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why, shoot with our bows and arrow
up there, tying a piece of string to it. It is not
a very high steeple.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cyrus, “and he’ll pull it up, and
then a stouter one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Good! Well, boys, get your
bows, and I will get the stuff,” said the boat&ndash;builder.</p>

<p>How carefully those young archers shot
steepleward their arrows, first attaching to the
latter a long, stout thread!</p>

<p>Oh, hands of the archers, tremble not! Oh,
winds above, blow not! And&mdash;and&mdash;over, yes,
just across the vane went the thread fastened
to Walter Plympton’s arrow! A cord was now
tied to the thread, the man carefully pulling it
up, and then there went to him a new clothes&ndash;line,
and down he came.</p>

<p>“Much obleeged to you!” he said.</p>

<p>“And we are obleeged to you!” replied
the sexton. “And here’s your money for the
job.”</p>

<p>As the stranger turned to go away, he laid
his hand on Walter’s shoulder, and said, “I saw
it was your arrer that did the work. I won’t
forgit it.”</p>

<p>Away he walked, disappearing down the
road that wound its dusty line through the
green forest.</p>

<p>All the time he had been with his new acquaintances,
he had not given his name. Indeed,
nobody asked for it. Walter remembered
him only as a man with a bushy beard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wonder if I shall ever see him again!”
thought Walter.</p>

<p>We shall find out.</p>

<p>The weeks slipped by, and winter at last
powdered the land as if it wished to give the
earth’s bald head a white wig.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE WINTER RIDE.</p>

<p>“I’m going to be warm,” said Walter
Plympton’s father, a man with rather
sharp features, of slender build, and
nervous, sensitive temperament. “Yes, I’m going
to be warm, and bundle up accordingly.”</p>

<p>“You will look like an Eskimo,” replied his
wife, who in her very laugh, so easy and deliberate,
as well as in her stout physical build, was
the opposite of her husband. “Those who see
you, Ezra, won’t fall in love with such a stuffed
creature.”</p>

<p>“They may keep the love, Louisa, and I’ll
hold on to the comfort. I believe in going warm
like the Chinese, who are said in cold weather
to increase the amount of their clothing, rather
than their heating apparatus. How that may
be, I don’t know; but I do know that I mean
to be warm. Kitty harnessed, Walter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father, and she’s waiting in the stable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“We will go out then. Oh, the family
umbrella!”</p>

<p>The family umbrella was an immense institution,
suspended like a big blue dome above
its holder, and promising to make a good parachute.
It had been bought at an auction, and
was one of those peculiarities often coming up
to the surface at such sales. For years, it had
proved a good friend on rough, rainy days.</p>

<p>“Do you expect a rain, father?”</p>

<p>“No, but I want to hold it up against the
wind. Hoist the sail, and our craft will be off.
Good&ndash;bye, Louisa. We will be home to&ndash;morrow
night, if a possible thing.”</p>

<p>“Good&ndash;bye, mother.”</p>

<p>“Good&ndash;bye. Do take care of yourselves.” And
after she said this, she watched the departing
team as Kitty slowly pulled the sleigh through
the white snow that had not settled since its
fall the day before, but stretched its diminutive
drifts in almost uninterrupted succession across
the road.</p>

<p>Kitty patiently plodded on, but she found the
snow deeper than she liked to pull the sleigh
through. The wind blew keen and strong, and
was like an axe&ndash;blade wielded by winter; but
the riders in the sleigh were safe behind the
blue umbrella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Walter Plympton differed, as well as his
mother, from Mr. Plympton. He was in looks
a “mother’s boy,” though his character was
varied with some of his father’s features of
mind. He was a stout, heavy youth of sixteen,
one of those growing boys too, from whose feet
their trousers, recently new, are soon discovered
to be running away, and whose wrists persist in
getting far below their coat&ndash;sleeves. He had his
mother’s round, full face. His complexion was
a rich brown, rather than fair and white. His
eyes were a bright hazel, and his hair of a shade
between brown and black. His voice was rather
heavy for one of his years, and was certain
to be heard among those shouting at “baseball,”
or “fox in the wall.” He shared in his
father’s sensitiveness of temperament, and like
him was enthusiastic. Unlike either father or
mother, the imaginative element was strongly
developed in his character. As to other qualities,
he was generous, rather thoughtless, and
his strong, ringing voice put him among those
unfortunate boys who are often told, “Don’t
speak so loud.” He had a very good sized estimate
of himself, was quite sure to be among the
speakers&mdash;and successful speakers&mdash;at a school
exhibition, and was ambitious to throw, in after
years, as large a shadow across the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
life’s events as Walter Plympton’s abilities
would possibly permit. There was no concealment
in his moves or motives; but open, honest,
and naturally confiding, he was sometimes the
dupe of boys cunning and suspicious. He was
too bright to be a dupe twice in the same day,
and when he discovered an enemy’s tricks,
would resent an invasion of rights as promptly,
stoutly, and noisily, as anybody. His good
nature and sociability made him popular. He
was rather fond of his books, was not afraid to
ask questions, and this made him an interesting,
intelligent companion. While there was a
large lump of the “boy” in him, he was a youth
of promise, and bade fair to be in after years a
success. His mother stated his greatest need,
when she said, “Walter needs a rudder to steer
him. He needs conversion, that is it. He
prays, and once in awhile reads his Bible, and
has no really bad habits. I want him to go
farther. I would like to see him beginning an
active religious life, openly, avowedly; and I do
hope soon he will confess his Saviour.”</p>

<p>Motherly Mrs. Plympton! How her thoughts
and her prayers went after her boy, like the
wings of a mother bird, flying after and hovering
over her young. And this winter morning
she had not forgotten to put up the often ascending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
prayer for her boy’s better life. She
stood at the window awhile, watching Kitty
and her load, and then stepped back to her
kitchen duties.</p>

<p>“Pretty hard going, father,” said the younger
occupant of the sleigh.</p>

<p>“It will be better out in the main road, and
we shall strike it soon. I wouldn’t start to&ndash;day,
but this is the last chance for going to the life
saving station as I promised, before you leave
for school; and you leave day after to&ndash;morrow,
and it is evident we must go to the station to&ndash;day,
if we go at all. But I think it will be all
right out in the main road.”</p>

<p>“Don’t the trees look handsome?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I never saw them prettier.”</p>

<p>The late fall of snow had draped forest and
field.</p>

<p>As our travelers proceeded on their journey,
the drifts deepened, rather than lessened. It
was toilsome traveling. By and by, they came
to a road skirted with telegraph&ndash;poles. Here
they were obliged to jump out and push the
sleigh.</p>

<p>“Father, let us begin to count the telegraph&ndash;poles.
That will help pass the time.”</p>

<p>“All right. One!” shouted Mr. Plympton,
as they passed the first of the long line of tall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
wooden travelers lining the highway, and
stretching ahead into the dark, green forest.</p>

<p>“Two&ndash;o&ndash;o!” cried Walter, so glad when he
could count off a single pole. They trudged
through the snow, pushing the sleigh, pulling
Kitty forward, calling out at intervals, “Three!
Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight!”</p>

<p>“Look, father! See those men!”</p>

<p>“I notice. I wonder what they are doing!”</p>

<p>Two men, a little distance ahead, ran out of
the woods dragging a long piece of timber.</p>

<p>“I guess they’re going to fix the telegraph
wire, Walter. The storm broke down some of
the wires.”</p>

<p>The men dropped the long timber directly
across the road and then darted into the woods
again.</p>

<p>“That’s cool, Walter! What do they want
to drop that in our path for?” The men were
now back again, sticking forked branches in
the snow; and they then laid the timber in the
forks.</p>

<p>“Can’t we go through?” asked Mr. Plympton
in a somewhat provoked tone.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t advise you to, Cap’n,” replied one
of the men who wore a red woolen jacket.
“You see the snow up ’long, is piled higher
than your horse’s back. We know, ’cause we’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
been breakin’ out the road; but the snow does
blow in wuss than pizen, and we concluded to
quit until the wind quits. Where you goin’,
Cap’n?”</p>

<p>“Down to the life saving station.”</p>

<p>“Wall, that’s your right road to take, the
one to the right, Cap’n. Of course, you can
go ahead, if you wish, but we don’t advise it,
as we have been thar, and know how rough
it is. That t’other road is the one you want to
take.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Father, I want to ask&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Plympton laughed, knowing Walter’s
disposition to ask questions, and that the process
once begun might be protracted too far for
the convenience of travelers.</p>

<p>“I will hold on if you will only ask <i>two</i>
questions.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I promise,” and laughing, Walter leaped
out into the snow, and walked up to the
men. He did not like to be limited to two
questions, but he submitted to his chains, and
having inquired about the depth of the snow
and the length of the road, he returned to the
sleigh.</p>

<p>“Only three miles by the road we take,
father, to Uncle Boardman’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“It is a new way to me. I have been accustomed
to travel by the road that is blocked, but
if this is a better road I am glad.”</p>

<p>As Kitty began to jingle her bells again, Mr.
Plympton said, “There, Walter! That’s a good
lesson. I call that a lesson about God’s providence,
which stops us from taking a certain
course, and we may feel as I did when those
men stopped me; but we are led to take a better
way. Left to ourselves, just now, we would
have run into a big drift.”</p>

<p>“I see, though in this life Providence does
not always make explanations, father.”</p>

<p>“No, we must wait till we get into another
life, to have all things explained.”</p>

<p>The road led through a forest of pines, heavily
coated. In a slow, stately fashion, these
swayed their tall, plumy tops. Beyond this
forest, the road was drifted once more. The
travelers had now a long tug at road&ndash;breaking,
but the drifts were all conquered. The country
grew more and more familiar. “The last
woods!” said Walter, as they passed a strip of
trees, whose trunks, coated on one side by the
storm, seemed like marble pillars, bearing up a
roof of green porphyry. Just beyond this, Walter
cried out, “Look, father!”</p>

<p>Mr. Plympton raised his eyes, and beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the white glitter of the snow, saw a strip of
vivid blue.</p>

<p>“The sea, father!”</p>

<p>“Ah, so it is!”</p>

<p>The sea stretched far away under the cold,
dark, frowning sky, and out of its waves rose
distant snow&ndash;covered islands, like frosted cakes
on a very blue table.</p>

<p>“There is Uncle Boardman’s, too, Walter.”</p>

<p>This was a farmhouse located near one corner
of the forest.</p>

<p>“Wonder if Uncle Boardman knows we are
so near, Walter?” asked Mr. Plympton, as
Kitty pulled the sleigh up to the open space between
the road and the green front door.</p>

<p>“Knows?” At that very moment, Boardman
Blake’s much loved, but much worn old
beaver, was about turning the corner of the
house, and under the beaver was Boardman.
Aunt Lydia’s spectacles were already at the
front door, and it was now swinging on its
hinges.</p>

<p>“Land sakes! Where did you come from?
I seed you from our back winder the moment
you turned out of the woods,” shrieked Aunt
Lydia. “I told Boardman it was some of our
folks, but he thought he knew better.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said a deeper, more agreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
voice, under the beaver, “what are you up to?
Why didn’t you wait till six feet more of snow
had fallen? Come in, come in. I’ll look after
your horse.”</p>

<p>The green front door quickly closed on the
travelers, and soon after Kitty disappeared behind
a red barn&ndash;door.</p>

<p>The wind had its own way once more in the
road, and undisturbed, kept the light snow
whirling, as if its mission were that of a broom,
to sweep if possible the open space before the
home of that honored couple, Boardman and
Lydia Blake.</p>

<h2 class="pc4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE LIFE SAVING STATION.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” exclaimed Mr. Plympton,
entering with Walter the life
saving station. “Jotham, how are
you?”</p>

<p>“Ezra, I am really glad to see you,” replied
Jotham Barney, the keeper of the station, with
much heartiness. “Take off your riggin’, and
make yourself at home.”</p>

<p>“Cap’n Barney,” as he was often labeled,
was a person about forty&ndash;five years old. He
was a sandy haired, sandy whiskered man, with
a light complexion, sharp, prominent nose, and
blue eyes that had a way of letting out flashes
when he spoke. “Cap’n Barney” was a very
social, talkative man, who had been “about
considerable,” though not always in first class
conveyances, and was ready to talk on almost
any subject. What he had not seen, what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
did not know, was not worth the seeing or
knowing. He thought very much of his own
opinion, and liked to brag; but he was a kindly
natured man, and people bore with his conceit,
because he was so chatty and pleasant. The
station to which “Uncle Sam” had appointed
him as the “keeper,” was a yellow building
about forty&ndash;five feet long, and perhaps eighteen
wide; and how tall was it? The roof supported
in its center a little railed platform
called the “lookout,” and this was between
twenty and twenty&ndash;five feet from the ground.
In the rear of the station was the living&ndash;room,
through whose preface of a little entry, Mr.
Plympton and Walter passed; then, entering
the apartment which was not only a kitchen,
but a dining&ndash;room; and not only a dining&ndash;room
but a sitting&ndash;room, a parlor, and everything,
except an apartment for sleeping. This living&ndash;room
was a little, unambitious place, lighted by
two windows toward the east. Between the
windows, was a cook&ndash;stove; and over this was a
wooden rack, from which hung a row of towels.
A clock stamped “U. S. L. S. S.” was ticking
steadfastly on one wall, and near it was a barometer.
In one corner, was a case marked “U.
S. L. S. S. Library, No.&mdash;.” Two patrol lanterns
were suspended below, and there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
also two sockets for Coston signals. Around
the walls in different places, were the overcoats,
hats, jackets, comforters, the station crew
had shed. Upon the entrance door, that served
as a kind of handy bulletin&ndash;board, were tacked
various circulars: “Merriman’s Patent Waterproof
Dress and Life&ndash;Preservers,” “Watchman’s
Improved Time&ndash;Detector”; circulars from the
Treasury Department about care of “Marine
Glasses,” upon “Leaves of absence,” and other
matters. The only other interesting objects in
the room were human, and these were members
of the station crew. They were all young men.
One was weaving a net. Two were playing
checkers. A fourth was officiating as cook;
and he was now cutting up salt fish.</p>

<p>Walter noticed everything with eager curiosity.
His father and the keeper had once
been schoolboys together, and as they were
very busily talking, Walter’s eyes could without
interruption travel from one object to another.</p>

<p>“Three doors in this room,” thought Walter;
“and one goes outdoors; and I wonder where
the other two go.”</p>

<p>He was relieved when the keeper said, “Ezra,
come upstairs, and see how we bunk for
the night. Then I will show you the boat&ndash;room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“That disposes of those two doors, I guess,”
reflected Walter.</p>

<p>One of these, approached from the kitchen
floor by a single step, the keeper was now
opening.</p>

<p>“Tumble up, Ezra, and see where we stay
nights,” was the keeper’s ready invitation.
Up the brown, unpainted stairs, they passed
into a little room, which seemed to be also an
entry, connecting the keeper’s room, at the left
over the kitchen, and the men’s quarters, at the
right.</p>

<p>“Here is my den,” said the keeper, turning
to the left. “Plain, you see everything is, but
at night when a feller is asleep, he doesn’t
know whether a Brussels carpet is on the floor,
or whether it is unpainted, like this. That is
my bed in the corner, and there you see I have
two windows toward the east, so I know when
it is sunrise. There’s my writin’ desk, they
allow me a chair or two, and so on.”</p>

<p>“Who rooms with you?” asked Mr.
Plympton.</p>

<p>“The clock up there! That is my chum;
always makin’ a noise, yet never in the way.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Then this is your room wholly,
Jotham?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Jotham, turning away with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
as much dignity as a sovereign leaving a bed&ndash;chamber
hung with royal purple.</p>

<p>“Now we will come back into the little
entry again at the head of the stairs.” It was
an entry that was also a narrow room.</p>

<p>“Here’s a bed, you see, in the corner; and I
have had the stove that was in my room set
here. It throws the heat into the men’s
quarters. We have a store&ndash;room on this floor,”
said the keeper, opening a door in a wooden
partition; “and we chuck various things in
there. Step into the men’s room.”</p>

<p>They passed into a long, low room in the
western end of the building. Here were six
wooden cot&ndash;beds ranged along two sides of the
room; and under the thick army blankets that
covered them, it seemed as if any tired surfman
would be comfortable. Near each bed was
either a blue chest or a trunk. At the two
ends of the room, were various articles suspended
from rows of hooks. Here were trousers, and
coats, and shirts; and one man, who could not
have believed in the beard movement, had here
hung his shaving&ndash;mug and razor&ndash;strop. Near
the windows in the western gable of the sloping
roof, was a row of paper signal&ndash;flags.</p>

<p>“What are those?” asked Walter.</p>

<p>“They are only pictures of signals that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of the men cut out of the signal&ndash;book. The
real signals, the cloth ones, we keep under the
lookout.”</p>

<p>“Could I see them?”</p>

<p>“Sartin. Come up this way,” and the obliging
keeper turned to climb a wooden stairway
running up from this room to the “lookout”
on the roof. Before they reached the lookout,
Walter saw in a little recess under the roof, a
box.</p>

<p>“There,” said the keeper, pulling the box
forward. “This is all full of little flags, or signals,
by which we can communicate with any
craft on the water. We keep ’em here, because
it is handy to have the signals where they can be
taken out to the lookout, and run up on the
flag&ndash;staff quick as possible.”</p>

<p>Walter looked up through the open scuttle,
and saw the lookout with its railing, and
above all rose the tapering flag&ndash;staff.</p>

<p>“We have one more room,” said the keeper.</p>

<p>“What’s that, Jotham?” inquired Mr.
Plympton.</p>

<p>“The boat&ndash;room. Come downstairs.”</p>

<p>They passed from the living&ndash;room directly
into a treasure house, whose contents made
Walter’s eyes sparkle with eager interest.</p>

<p>“That the boat!” exclaimed Walter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, she’s a beauty,” replied the keeper,
fondly stroking its gunwale as if it were a
thing of life, and would feel every touch of his
caressing hand. “That’s our surf&ndash;boat.”</p>

<p>The surf&ndash;boat had the place of honor in the
room, occupying all its center, and reaching
almost from the wall of the living&ndash;room to the
big door in the western wall.</p>

<p>“It must be over twenty feet long,” thought
Walter, who began to fill up with questions,
until his brain seemed charged as fully as a
loaded mitrailleuse. How many articles there
were in that boat&ndash;room, adapted to the life&ndash;saving
work, and in such readiness, that a wreck
near shore might be sure of a visit and of rescue,
if there were any possible chance for such
relief! There were guns for throwing lines, and
there were the lines to be thrown. There was
a life&ndash;car, that could be swung along a line to a
wreck; and there was a breeches&ndash;buoy, and
there were&mdash;Oh how many articles! The desire
for information was swelling to an intolerable
size within Walter’s soul, and he was
about to gratify the longing, when to his great
disappointment, a door opened, and a face with
a bushy beard was thrust into the boat&ndash;room
from the living&ndash;room.</p>

<p>“Cap’n!” called out Bush&ndash;beard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“What say?”</p>

<p>“Could I see you ’bout my patrollin’ to&ndash;night,
one minute?”</p>

<p>“Why, father,” said Walter, in a low voice
to Mr. Plympton, “that is the man that fixed
the vane on the steeple!”</p>

<p>The man of the steeple had recognized them,
and was now saying, “How d’ye do?” at the
same time he advanced, and held out a broad,
brown hand to the visiting party.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you,” said Mr. Plympton.</p>

<p>“You know Tom Walker?” asked the
station&ndash;keeper.</p>

<p>“Guess I do,” replied Walter, readily gripping
Tom Walker’s brown hand.</p>

<p>“I s’pose, Tom, you want to see me about
your beat. Let me see. You are on watch
from eight till twelve?”</p>

<p>“That’s it, Cap’n. All right, if you understand
it. That is what I wanted.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I wish&mdash;” Walter stopped.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Mr. Plympton.</p>

<p>“Why, I was thinking I would like to go
with Tom Walker, a while you know, just to
see what it is like.”</p>

<p>“You can, if you wish and your father is
willing. Tom would like ’mazin’ well to
have company,” said the keeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sartin!” cried Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’m willing, Walter,” said Mr. Plympton.
“Only don’t be gone too long, as your Aunt
Lydia would like, I guess, to have the house
shut up before twelve. We will go over there
now. Thank you, Jotham, for showing us
round.”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome. I will expect your boy to&ndash;night.
He’d better be here before eight.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give him a welcome,” added Tom. “I
haven’t forgotten a kindness he did me.”</p>

<p>“I will be on hand,” declared the happy
Walter.</p>

<p>Mr. Plympton and Walter turned away from
the station, and took a narrow lane running
from the beach up to Boardman Blake’s; and
there the lane was promoted, and became a
highway. As if to acknowledge that promotion,
and wave the road a graceful, stately wish
for success on its travels, a single elm had been
planted where the way widened. The Blake
home had been standing there about fifty years;
having been built by Boardman Blake’s father.
It was a two&ndash;story house; its green front door
piercing the wall exactly in the middle. On
one side of the front door was the parlor, open
only on great occasions, like funerals, or
“comp’ny.” Behind this was the kitchen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
On the other side of the front door, the right,
was the store; and in its rear, the sitting&ndash;room.</p>

<p>“I like to have things handy,” said Uncle
Boardman to Walter’s father; “and I can jest
slip from our sittin’&ndash;room to the store and ’tend
to customers, and then slip back.”</p>

<p>It was in the sitting&ndash;room, that Uncle Boardman,
Aunt Lydia, and the Plymptons were
gathered before the large, open&ndash;mouthed fire&ndash;place.
Supper had been spread at an early
hour on the round dining&ndash;table in the kitchen,
and the light had not wholly faded from the
west, when the Blakes and their guests withdrew
to the sitting&ndash;room. One could look from
the fire on the hearth, to those flames the sun
had kindled on a rival hearth, about the western
hills; but the glow of the latter went out,
leaving only ashy clouds behind; while Boardman’s
fire continued to flare and crackle into
the night.</p>

<p>“You did have courage to start to&ndash;day to
come down here,” said Aunt Lydia to Walter’s
father, having adjusted herself in her easy
rocking&ndash;chair, and having adjusted also in her
waist the corn&ndash;cob that held and steadied her
knitting.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it was our last chance before
Walter went away. Then when I started, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
did not know it was so bad. I thought when I
struck the main road after leaving our house,
we could get along easily enough. I think,
too, over this way, you have had more snow
than we. I didn’t know these facts; and when
one has begun, you know he don’t like to give
it up.”</p>

<p>“There, if that isn’t Boardman!” exclaimed
Aunt Lydia, throwing down her knitting&ndash;work
in her lap as if to emphasize her point. “There
has been a man round, Bezaleel Baggs (I
call him Belzebub), and he wants to buy up a
lot of Boardman’s woodland. Boardman has
got the idea he’d better sell, and he does hate
to give it up! I don’t like that Beza&mdash;no,
Belzebub. I don’t like his looks or&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tinkle, tinkle,” went a little bell in the
direction of the store.</p>

<p>“Store, store!” now shrieked Aunt Lydia in
the ears of her spouse, and there was need of
the shriek. Uncle Boardman had contentedly
folded his hands in his ample lap, and his head
was rising and falling with as much regularity
as the tides out in the adjacent ocean; but of
course much oftener. “Store,” though, was the
magic word that could bring Boardman any
time out of the depths of the most profound
evening nap. Rising promptly, he made his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to the sitting&ndash;room door, and then into the store
lighted by its one kerosene lamp on the scarred
wooden counter. Aunt Lydia followed him
softly to the door, and thrust forward her
sharply featured face. She came back with a
pair of flashing dark eyes, flashing all the
brighter behind her spectacles; and holding up
one hand significantly, said in a half&ndash;whisper,
“I took a peek! It’s <i>he</i>! I knowed as much.”</p>

<p>“Who?” inquired Walter’s father.</p>

<p>“Belzebub&mdash;there, Boardman says I ought
not to call him that! Well, it’s the same old
fox, that Baggs.”</p>

<p>“You don’t like him?”</p>

<p>“No, not one bit!” and in her intensity of
feeling she sat down forcibly on the corn&ndash;cob,
that ally in Aunt Lydia’s knitting&ndash;work, and
carelessly left in her chair.</p>

<p>“There!” said she jumping up. “I’ve broken
that ’ere cob. I wish it had been Bel&mdash;there, I
s’pose I ought not to say that.”</p>

<p>Walter felt that the situation at Uncle Boardman’s
had suddenly become very interesting;
but he remembered his appointment at the
station. He rose and began to put on his
overcoat.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE PATROL.</p>

<p>Walter was sitting in the living&ndash;room
of the station. It was almost eight
o’clock. Two men came stumbling
downstairs, and with a sleepy air entered
the room. Seating themselves, they began to
put on their huge rubber boots. One of the
men was Tom Walker.</p>

<p>“How are ye?” he said, nodding to Walter
in a friendly way. “Goin’?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I am here for.”</p>

<p>A footstep in the entry was now heard.
A man entered, wearing a stout, heavy black
coat, and black trousers, and he carried a
lantern in his hand. It was the patrol from
the easterly end of the beach.</p>

<p>“Cold!” was his one word of greeting, as
he set his lantern on the table. He also deposited
there a leather pouch attached to a
long leather strap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Another step was heard in the entry, and
a man appeared who wore a thick blue blouse
and blue trousers, and had a very much padded
look. He was the patrol from the westerly
end of the beach. He expressed his opinion
that it was cold by silently going to the stove;
and there he stood rubbing his hands in the
warm atmosphere. He had already deposited
a leather pouch on the table. Tom Walker and
the other arrival from upstairs, were dressing
for their duty as patrolmen in the place of the
two whose chilling wintry beat had just been
accomplished. Tom put on a Guernsey jacket,
and then drew over it a short, thick sack coat.
He pulled a cap of shaggy cloth down over his
hair, drew close the ear&ndash;laps, and then took
up a pair of thick, warm mittens lying under
the stove.</p>

<p>“Here,” said the keeper to Walter. “Before
you start, let me show you what the men take
with them.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he lifted a leather pouch that
had been deposited on the table. It was a circular
case of leather, about four inches in
diameter, containing a “time&ndash;detector”; its
works resembling those of a chronometer.
Taking out a key and opening the detector, the
keeper said, “I thought you might like to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
this. There, I have put this round card in
the detector. You see it is marked off into
hours, and ten minutes, and five minutes, and
is called the dial. The patrol takes it with
him, and at the end of his beat he puts a
key in that hole you see, and gives the key
a turn. A kind of punch, stamped like a die,
is forced down on the dial. In the morning,
I open the detector, and there is the
dial that tells if he has done his duty.
These dials I forward once a week to Washington.”</p>

<p>“Supposing the man don’t want to go his
beat, and turns the key somewhere this side
of the end of the route?” asked Walter.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the keeper, “the feller can’t play
’possum that way. He must go to the end of
his beat to get his key. It is at a house there.
He must go that far, you see, anyway.”</p>

<p>“As any feller of honor would, key or no
key,” growled Tom Walker.</p>

<p>“Oh, sartin, sartin, Tom,” replied the keeper.
“They didn’t get it up for you, but for the
fellers in some&mdash;some&mdash;other station.”</p>

<p>And Tom’s growl changed to a pleasant
laugh. “Where’s my Coston signal?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” replied the keeper.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Walter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is for signaling to anybody on the water
in the night, and this burns a red light.”</p>

<p>The Coston signal was a few inches long,
marked on the bottom with the word, “Patrol.”</p>

<p>“This,” said the keeper, “fits into a socket
on one end of this wooden handle which you
see I have. At the other end is that brass
knob. When I want to use my signal, I
strike that knob, and it forces a rod up into a
little hole in the end of the signal. That
strikes a percussion cap, and ignites a fusee, and
out flashes a red light. That is my explanation
of it.”</p>

<p>Out into the cold, shadowy night, they
went. Tom led off, slouching along heavily,
carelessly yet doggedly; as if he had a duty
before him which he did not wholly relish, but
meant to put it through, like a horse in a treadmill,
whose greatest concern is to put one foot
before the other, and to keep putting until
lunch time. There was a bright glitter of
stars in the sky, and the land was white with
the pure snow; but where the sea stretched
toward the east, was one vast mass of blackness.
Out of this blackness, came a voice,
that shouted all along the shore, “Ho&mdash;ho&mdash;ho&mdash;ho!”
The sea was very smooth, and the
sound of the surf was not heavy enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
interrupt the conversation between Tom and
Walter.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” began Walter, “these stations
are scattered all along the coast.”</p>

<p>“They are all over the country in spots. I
’magine in some places they are few as muskeeters
in December. Then again they are
pretty thick, say on the Jersey coast. Government
takes care of ’em all. So many stations&mdash;more
or less&mdash;makin’ a deestrict, under the
care of a superintendent. Then all these deestricts
are under Gen. Sumner I. Kimball at
Washington. Every deestrict, too, has its
inspector.”</p>

<p>“How many men do you have to have at
this station?”</p>

<p>“There is the keeper, Keeper Barney&mdash;we
Cap’n him jest among ourselves&mdash;and there are
seven surfmen here. We have a cook also. I
am a surfman and then I am called a patrolman
too. I’m a patrolman now, but just let a
vessel show itself off there, and I should be a
surfman in less than no time.”</p>

<p>“You don’t stay here all the time?”</p>

<p>“Through the year? No, we come on the
first of September, and we go off the first of
May. They don’t have the same dates in all
the stations. The idea is to be here when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
there’s the most danger. Our keeper, though,
has to be lookin’ arter things, comin’ here now
and then, through the year. He’s keeper, summer
and winter.”</p>

<p>“How do you like your work?”</p>

<p>“Well, I like the pay, fifty dollars a month,
but it’s hard, resky work.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been on?”</p>

<p>“Nine years.”</p>

<p>“What is your worst kind of weather?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s tough when there’s a light snow,
and a stiff nor’&ndash;west wind keeps it a blowin’, or
a nor’&ndash;east storm, when it hails and comes
slashin’ into your face. It’s bad most any
time when the lantern goes out. You see
we have to pick our way; good enough on
the sand when it’s hard, but among the rocks,
it’s hobbly; and it may be pretty snowy if you
can’t foller the beach.”</p>

<p>“Does your lantern go out?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes. You have to grope your way
the best you can, then.”</p>

<p>“You must have seen some tough times.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been an hour and a half goin’ a mile,”
exclaimed Tom with the air of a veteran who
has fought his hundred battles, and won at
least ninety&ndash;nine. “Poky work, I tell ye!”</p>

<p>“How do you divide your watches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“We have four watches, and two men go
out at a time. I go to this end of the beach,
and t’other man goes to t’other end. Where
two station deestricts join, the patrolmen from
the stations meet, and exchange what they call
‘checks,’ that they give to their keepers.”</p>

<p>“How is it your watches run?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the hours? From sunset till eight, is
the first watch, and from eight to twelve is the
second, and from twelve till four is the third;
and then there’s from four till sunrise. Then by
day, we have to watch. If it’s thick weather,
fog, or rain, or snow, if we can’t see two miles
each way from the station, we have to go out
agin. If it is clear weather, we just watch
from the lookout, on the buildin’. One man
has to be on the lookout, and he reports all
vessels goin’ by. You saw the lookout?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Do you ever use that Coston
signal?”</p>

<p>“Yes, though not much this winter thus far.
I have only used mine twice thus far. A fishin’
vessel was the last one. She got in too near
shore, and I burned my light, so that she might
take the hint and haul off.”</p>

<p>“The ice must be piled up bad on the beach,
sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve seen it twenty feet high. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
wind drives the snow down on the beach, and
the sea washes over it, and it freezes; and then
more snow may come to be washed and to
freeze over, and so on.”</p>

<p>“Out in a cold rain or hail, don’t it bother
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; take hail, and it’s tough. Why, I’ve
seen a man come into the station, and his
clothes would be so stiff and frozen, he&mdash;he&mdash;couldn’t
get ’em off hisself.”</p>

<p>By this time, Tom had reached the end of
his beat. He slouched along in the rear of a
barn, turned its corner, and then stopped before
an object that shone in the light of the lantern.
It was a key attached by a chain to the wall.
Tom took the key, put it into a hole in his
detector, turned it till a sharp click was heard;
and then Walter knew this faithful recorder
had made its mark on the dial. The patrolman
turned, and began the journey back to the station.
Crossing a field of snow, they struck the shore
rocks once more, and then moved out upon the
wet, sloping sands. A short walk brought
them again to the upper rim of the beach,
strewn with snow.</p>

<p>The lantern flashed its light down upon a
footprint.</p>

<p>“Whose is that?” asked Walter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“T’other patrol’s; one afore me. He’s got a
foot big enough to cover up a pumpkin hill.”</p>

<p>Slowly, Tom and Walter returned to the
station.</p>

<p>“I suppose I must say good night, and go to
my aunt’s now.”</p>

<p>“Wish <i>I</i> had an aunt’s to go to, now. My
beat is short, and I must go over it twice more,
afore I turn in at twelve. If you are down at
the station in the morning, you’ll see on my
detector the proof that I’ve been faithful; but I
would be, without the thing,” said the sensitive
knight of the beach. Walter watched Tom as
he turned his face again toward the dark sea
and the lonely beach. The light of the lantern
steadily dwindled till it seemed like that of a
star about to dip beneath the waters of the
ocean and disappear; and dip and disappear it
did, as Tom stumbled over the shore rocks
down upon the beach. Walter went slowly
along the lane to Uncle Boardman’s.</p>

<p>In the morning, he was at the station again.</p>

<p>“Do you want to see me open the detectors?”
said the keeper to Walter. “Come here then.”</p>

<p>Walter watched the keeper as he opened one
of the detectors.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, removing a card or dial.
“Do you see those marks?”</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Walter could detect little stamps in the form
of a cross.</p>

<p>“There is Tom Walker’s record,” said the
keeper. “One stamp was fifteen minutes of
nine, when you went down; another at ten
minutes of ten, and the third at eleven. That
shows that Tom Walker did his duty.”</p>

<p>“And he would have done it anyway,”
growled the sensitive Tom. “I don’t like to
have that thing nag me round. I do my
duty.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, yes, sartin,” replied the keeper in a
mollifying tone.</p>

<p>“Did you burn your light after I left you?”
inquired Walter. “I mean your signal.”</p>

<p>“No, nothin’ turned up.”</p>

<p>“What would you have done if it had?”
inquired Walter. “Say, if you had seen a
wreck, what then?”</p>

<p>“What would he have done?” said the
keeper, answering for the surfman, and answering
in an oratorical fashion. “What would
he have done? My! Wouldn’t he have flown
round! He’d have out with that signal and
burnt it in less than no time. Then he would
have run to the station, big rubber boots and all,
roused the crew, and we might have had to run
out the boat and get a line to the wreck,” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the keeper, as he proceeded, seeing the effect his
earnestness had on his young auditor, grew
quite dramatic in his gestures.</p>

<p>“Wish I could see it!” thought Walter.
But that was not possible. His return home
must be effected that very afternoon.</p>

<p>“I am leaving so many things behind,” he
reasoned, “that I really ought not to go.
There are so many things about the station I
would like to understand; and what a funny
store Uncle Boardman has! And there is that
man, ‘Belzebub’ Baggs; I wonder if he will
get Uncle Boardman to sell him that land!”</p>

<p>There was no alternative; Walter must go.
He left behind, Uncle Boardman, and Aunt
Lydia, the store, “Belzebub” Baggs, the station,
Tom Walker, Capt. Barney, the crew, the wide,
blue ocean so full of unrest and storm.</p>

<p>“Get up, Katy!” shouted Mr. Plympton.
“Now, home with ye!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">TURNING THE CORNER.</p>

<p>The journey home was not a difficult
one for Katy, as the roads were broke
out thoroughly by this time. The journey,
the subsequent day however, was a hard
one for Mr. and Mrs. Plympton, as they went
with Walter to the cars to see him safely started
for his ride to Franklin Academy.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Walter, who was not so absorbed
in school&ndash;plans but that he could see two pairs
of misty eyes when he chanced to turn suddenly
toward them, “don’t feel bad, father and
mother. You know I shall be back by the
first of August, and you know, father, what you
said about time going like a sled, the iron on
whose runner is rubbed smooth.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said his father soberly.</p>

<p>“Be a good boy, Walter,” was his mother’s
last reminder. About fifty had preceded it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
but she kept this as the last. The next minute,
there were two solemn faces on the platform of
a country station, gazing intently at a car window
that moved off rapidly and framed but for
a moment a young, eager, ambitious, hopeful
face.</p>

<p>Walter’s stay at Franklin Academy was not
an eventful one outwardly. There was the
usual course of instruction for a boy of sixteen,
and Walter acquitted himself creditably. There
was the usual proportion of “bad boys and
small scrapes,” but Walter had no affinity for
them and was known as a warm&ndash;hearted, enthusiastic
youth, but not at all as a wild one.
He gained some note as a fine gymnast. Day
after day the academy bell tinkled out its mild
warnings that study or recitation hours had
arrived, and day after day, the same flock of
boys and girls passed along the shaded walks
traversing the academy yard. Outwardly, as
already asserted, Walter’s academy course was
without special incident. In the boy’s personal
private history though, a very important corner
was turned. That which led to the turn
was singular also.</p>

<p>It was “composition day” in the academy,
and various young essayists had read their
opinions upon “School days,” “A Summer landscape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>,”
and “George Washington.” Then came
May Elliott’s piece of pen&ndash;work. May was not
very generally known by the students. Her
home was not in town, and the people with
whom she boarded lived two miles away, so
that the students did not see very much of her
apart from her class hours. Although not
pretty, yet her face interested you. Her blue
eyes had a certain bright, positive look, as if she
had something to say to you, and they arrested
your attention. The subject of her composition
was this, “What are we living for?” Her
course of thought was to specify the aims of
different people in life, their worthiness and
unworthiness; and then she closed in this fashion:
“The life that does not take into account
the need of those about us, that does not take
into account another life, that does not take
God into account, is making,&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here May looked up in her bright, positive
way. It was a chance look that she gave in the
direction of the north&ndash;east rather than the
north&ndash;west corner of the schoolroom. “Making&mdash;a
serious mistake,” said May. In the north&ndash;east
corner sat two students on opposite sides
of the same aisle, Walter Plympton and Chauncy
Aldrich. Each student said, “Does she mean
me?” May Elliott did not mean either individual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
It was a chance movement of her eyes,
but like many of our movements that without
intent are very significant in their results, the
look set two young men to thinking. After
school, they discussed the merits of May’s
theme and treatment. Chauncy was the first
speaker. He was a very forcible looking young
man, one who seemed to come at you and
collide with you, although he might be a
hundred feet off. He brushed up his hair in
a mighty roll above his forehead, and that gave
his head the look of a battering&ndash;ram. He was
nicknamed “Solomon,” as he talked and acted
as if he carried more native and more acquired
wisdom in his head than all the students, all
the teachers, and all the trustees of Franklin
Academy bunched together. And yet he was
rather liked in school, as he had a bright, pleasant
face, was generally smiling, and combined
with a really selfish nature, an apparent readiness
to help everybody that came along.</p>

<p>“Walter,” said Chauncy, as they went away
from the academy together, “What do you
think of May Elliott’s composition?”</p>

<p>“I thought it was quite good. Anyway she
looked over in my corner as if she meant me.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought. I didn’t know but
she was looking at me, as much as to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
‘Chauncy, this is meant for you.’ However,
Miss Elliott, you may keep looking all day, and
I shall only take what I please of it, and you
may dispose of the rest in what market you
please.” Here Chauncy pushed back his hat;
and his front knob of hair came into prominence,
and looked very belligerent, as if warning
Miss Elliott to be careful how she threw her
ink&ndash;arrows in that direction.</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t suppose she really meant anything
personal, Chauncy.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not; but my motto is to be on the
lookout, and not take people as meaning to give
you a higher per cent than human nature is inclined
to allow you.”</p>

<p>Chauncy was professedly preparing himself
for a “business life,” and terms like “per cent,”
“market,” “stock,” were favorite words in his
vocabulary. The wise man now resumed his
conversation.</p>

<p>“The fact is, with regard to what she said
about other folks’ need, and another life, and so
on, those things of course are so; but as for my
needy neighbor, why, look at my needy self&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!”</p>

<p>Here Chauncy gave one of his quick, ready
laughs, that had something of the sound of a
new half dollar when you throw it on a counter;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
ringing, yet hard and metallic. “There is my
Uncle Bezaleel. His motto is, ‘Don’t forget
number one,’ and how he has pulled the money
in! Nobody stands higher in the market.”</p>

<p>“Bezaleel?” asked Walter, catching at the
word.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bezaleel Baggs.”</p>

<p>“Beelzebub your uncle?” Walter was about
to say, remembering Aunt Lydia’s habit of
speech; but he checked this imprudent phraseology
and remarked, “Bez&mdash;Bezaleel Baggs
your uncle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a smart one. He is a great land&ndash;owner,
buying up whole forests, and he runs
mills and so on. He expects to give me a lift,
perhaps take me in business with him. That’s
my uncle.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” thought Walter.</p>

<p>“Oh,” resumed Chauncy, “we were speaking
of May Elliott’s composition. Well, I was going
to say about her pious remarks at the close, that
they are well enough in their place, of course;
but if she meant me when she looked our way,
I only want to say that there will be time for
that by and by. <i>You</i> can think them over, if
you want to.”</p>

<p>Walter made no reply and the two separated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a casual remark, “You can think
them over,” and at another time, Walter might
quickly have forgotten the words. Somehow
that day, the words stayed with Walter. They
seemed to have roots, and they took hold of
Walter’s thoughts, and went deep down into his
soul, and there they clung.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what the matter is why I keep
thinking of that composition,” he said, later in
the day.</p>

<p>“You look sober, Walt,” observed Chauncy.</p>

<p>“Thinking,” replied Walter laughing.</p>

<p>“About that composition&mdash;eh? Well, here
is one who is not,” and the wise man gave two
or three satisfied little chuckles.</p>

<p>“Why should he fancy I was thinking about
that composition?” Walter asked himself. “I
am, though, and can’t seem to get rid of it.”</p>

<p>He went to his boarding&ndash;place, passed directly
to his room, and sat down in a chair by the
western window. There was an outlook across
a stretch of green fields waving with grain, up
to a round&ndash;topped hill, bushy with vigorous
oaks. Over a shoulder of this hill peeped another,
but so distant, that a veil of blue haze
covered it all day. The stillness of the hour, for
it was at twilight, the sun going down behind
hangings of crimson along the blue hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
made a quiet in Walter’s breast, and suggested
thoughts that in the hurry and noise of the day
are not likely to be fostered.</p>

<p>“Oh, that composition, ‘What are we living
for?’” thought Walter. “Well, what <i>am</i> I
living for?”</p>

<p>Was he living for others? He did trust he
was a help to those at home, and yet he had no
conscious, definite purpose to give himself for
their welfare; and as for those outside, he certainly
hoped he had done them no harm,
and he ventured to think he might have
granted a few favors, but he had not thought
in a very special way about anybody except
Walter Plympton. He had gone on in a boy’s
careless fashion, meaning in a general way to
mind his parents and consult their welfare; and
to do “about the fair thing by outsiders,” was
also his thought. As for that other life which
we must all meet, the whole subject to his
mind was in a hazy condition like the distant
blue hill he was looking at. Once a week,
while sitting in St. Mary’s at home, the old rector
saying some solemn thing in the pulpit or
the choir singing a plaintive tune, he was
quite likely to think of another life. The other
six days, he was thinking of school, and farmwork,
and his duties at home, or play, outside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
And as for thoughts about God, they would
chase through his mind like the shadows of
clouds across a green summer field. They might
visit him at family prayers, or on Sunday, in
church, or when praying by himself at home;
but like the hasty cloud&ndash;shadows, such thoughts
were soon gone. His general attitude toward
all these subjects was that of a thoughtless indifference;
and any particular attention he paid
now and then was the result of a mere habit
of going to church, or the saying of hurried
prayers, rather than a direct preference and
purpose of his heart.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I am where I ought to be in
such matters,” was Walter’s conclusion, and if
he had a comfortable satisfaction in himself
when he began to think, it had now melted
away like a snow&ndash;bank in a spring rain.</p>

<p>“The sun has been down, some time,” he
said at last, “and the bright colors have all
faded out of the sky. It looks pretty sober
over there now.”</p>

<p>Walter felt, as the sky looked, “sober.” The
distant blue hill had quickly turned to a dark,
undefined mass of shadow. The hill near by
went behind a veil. Soon, the fields shrank out
of sight, like green scrolls rolled up and taken
away. Walter rose and left the room. He did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
not leave his thoughts behind. Those went
with him. For several days, he was thinking
upon that subject: “What am I living for?”
The longer he thought, the more deficient
seemed his life. There came another night
when he bowed his head in prayer as never before.
Feeling his unworthiness, how poor and
mean his life had been, he asked God to forgive
him. Feeling that his life had been without
a strong, definite, acceptable purpose, he
asked God to take him, and help him live for
the highest ends. And there rose up before
him Jesus Christ, as the expression of God’s
readiness to forgive a past, deficient life, sincerely
regretted; Jesus Christ, as the perfect,
divine Guide by which to direct all our lives
in the future; Jesus Christ, his Saviour from
sin. A letter arrived for the Plymptons one
day, and it read thus:</p>


<p class="pbq p1">“<i>Dear Father and Mother</i>: I suppose you will be surprised
to get this, but I wanted to tell you of something that has
interested me and I know will interest you. I have made
up my mind, God helping me, to be a different person. I
hope I haven’t been what people call a bad boy, but still, I
might have been better, and thought more of your interests,
and tried hard to do my duty toward God. You will forgive
me for all my thoughtlessness, won’t you? And you will
pray for me, please, won’t you? Your affectionate son,</p>

<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Walter</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">“The dear boy!” exclaimed Mrs. Plympton.
“Yes, father and I will pray for you, won’t
we?”</p>

<p>Mr. Plympton could only nod assent, for the
tears filled his eyes. Indeed there were two
people in that house who often looked at one
another with red eyes that day, but it was the
redness that goes with happy hearts, with the
bright hopes of a morning sky, and not the
glare of a sad fire that destroys our dearest
interests.</p>

<p>It may have been two weeks after the arrival
of the above letter, that another came.</p>

<p>“Here is a letter from your brother Boardman,”
said Mr. Plympton, entering the kitchen,
where his wife was cooking her weekly batch
of pies. “Open it, please, and see what he
says.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Plympton wiped carefully her floury
hands, adjusted her spectacles, and sitting down
by a window where the light streamed in
across the hollyhocks and sunflowers in the
yard, began to read:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“<i>Dear Ezra and Louisa</i>:&mdash;We are all well, and hope you
are the same. I suppose you are expecting Walter home
before long, this summer, and I got the impression from you
that he was not going back again. I think I can give him a
job this fall and winter if you agree to it, and I’ll see that he
has good wages. I have always, with Lydia’s help, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
know, managed my store and post&ndash;office myself, but I expect
I shall need the help of a clerk. I have sold a lot of land,
timber land, to Mr. Bezaleel Baggs; and I am putting up a
steam mill, and I am interested in it, and it is going to take
me away from the store a good deal. Then I have engaged
to supply the crew at the life saving station with provisions,
and also to take their mail to them. So you see somebody
has got to go and look after their orders, and fetch
their goods, and it is more than I can conveniently look
after. What do you say to letting Walter come here the
first of September? Please let me know soon.</p>

<p class="pr6">“Your affectionate brother,</p>
<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Boardman Blake</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1">“Well, Ezra, what do you say?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;don’t know. I sort of hate to have
him away, Louisa.”</p>

<p>“So do I.”</p>

<p>“I suppose though, he must start some time
to be doing for himself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, here is a postscript! Tucked away up
in one corner. I almost lost sight of it.”</p>

<p>“What does it say?”</p>

<p>“‘P. S.&mdash;He can come home every week.’
That makes it different, Ezra.”</p>

<p>“And it’s only ten miles away. I suppose
he’ll be just crazy to see that life saving
station.”</p>

<p>“So he will. When he came back last winter,
he said it was just aggravating to think he
could not stay longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Let us write to Walter and see what he
says.”</p>

<p>The result of all this was that the first day
of September, when the life saving station
was opened for the season, there appeared at the
door Uncle Boardman’s new clerk, to receive the
daily order for the crew’s provisions.</p>

<p>“I am beginning a new life,” thought Walter.</p>

<p>It was a new life in many ways. About six
months ago, the careless, laughing, kindly&ndash;natured
youth at home, had left it to assume new
responsibilities elsewhere, at the academy. He
had come back still happy and laughing, but
a new and earnest purpose had entered his soul,
and was controlling him. He had since been
confirmed, in the little village church, openly
acknowledging his Saviour. He had entered his
uncle’s neighborhood to meet and assume fresh
responsibilities. He would come in contact
with the men at the life saving station. He
would meet others in his daily business duties.
Would he keep and increase the religion he had
brought with him? Would it lessen?</p>

<p>“I shall try hard to do my duty,” said Walter,
in his thoughts.</p>

<p>We shall see what he did.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE STORE.</p>

<p>The morning after his arrival at his
uncle’s, Walter began his new duties
as clerk, and opened the store. It was
in the south&ndash;western corner of the house,
and was also in a corner made by two
roads. One was the lane that came up from
the life saving station, widening into a road
which went to the outside world. The
second, starting at the store, continued its
travels in an easterly direction, and ended
them in a little fishing village overlooking
the sea. Opening from the store into these
two roads, as if to solicit and take up all
passing custom, were two doors, and each
was bordered by two windows. Above
one of these doors, that on the road to
the outside world, was a small sign, and
it said, “B. Blake”; but said it very faintly.
The sign once was black, and the name had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
been painted in gilt letters; but the rains
had been scouring the sign for years, and the
sun bleaching it; and between the scouring and
the bleaching, there had resulted a surface of
shabby, blackish gray, streaked with dim, yellow
lines. The store, as well as the sign, looked
old. The entire house looked old. So did its
owner, Boardman Blake; and the great, dark
forest of pines beyond the house seemed to murmur
day and night, “Growing old, growing
old!” As one entered the store, in a very hospitable
location between the two doors, he saw
a rusty box stove flanked by two benches. The
benches in winter rarely were without an occupant.
In the spring, summer, and fall, these
occupants in part were out on the sea, pulling
into their uneasy boats, cod, hake, or haddock;
while some were following the plow, hoeing corn
or pitching the fragrant hay into bulky carts.
Behind the benches, on the wall, were posters,
announcing to a generally neglectful and ungrateful
world, that “Vandyke’s Life&ndash;Bitters”
would cure dyspepsia; that “Peaslee’s Liniment”
never failed to take the stiffness out of a horse’s
joints; while “Payson’s Hair Elixir” was sure
to vitalize a bald head into the manufacturing
of rich, luxuriant locks. The counters bordered
two sides of the store, and sustained the weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of a desk in one corner where Boardman attended
to his scanty book&ndash;keeping. Then there
were two faded old show&ndash;cases whose store of
peppermints, lozenges in gaudy wrappings, and
gumdrops of every known rainbow&ndash;tint, excited
the admiration of every schoolboy. There
were also several pairs of scales, and a cheesebox.
Behind the counters, ranged on shelves
that began in some mysterious space below the
counters’ level, and reached to the dusty, fly&ndash;specked
ceiling, was an assortment of goods
that only a country store can produce. There
was not very much of any one article, but so
many articles were gathered there that variety
made up fully for quantity. There were dry
goods, and goods that were not dry, such as
bottles of medicine and essences; there were
outfits for the farmer, and outfits for the fisherman.
Hardware was there, like hammers and
planes; and software, like sugar and meal.
Goods were there, like boots and shoes; and
goods like caps and clothing. As the storekeeper
generally had only one suit of clothes on
hand at a time, there was but little range of
choice for the customer, and if compelled to take
what he could find, a giant might have gone away
wretched in the suit of a dwarf, or the dwarf departed
only to be lost in the apparel of a giant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The store excited Walter’s interest, and as
he opened it that first morning, his eyes made
a rapid inventory of its miscellaneous contents.</p>

<p>“And what is that?” he asked, noticing a
shelf on which were clustered a few books.
They were not for sale, but their titles and well&ndash;thumbed
condition showed that they were for
reference. One was a state gazetteer, another a
volume of state laws, a third a small English
dictionary, and a fourth was a Bible. The latter
was bound in old leather covers, and its
type was antique. It seemed to be a kind of
safe, as well as aid to devotion, for various
documents were there, like deeds and bills.</p>

<p>“What is this?” exclaimed Walter, as a
piece of paper fluttered out of the old Bible
when he chanced to lift and open the book.
“Uncle has a lot of papers in it, and I must
look out. I must put this back.”</p>

<p>He could not but see the figures, five hundred,
in the left hand corner of the document,
and carelessly had read, “For value
received, I promise to pay Bezaleel Baggs, or
order, five hundred dollars.” Walter stopped.</p>

<p>“I must not read that, and did not intend
to,” thought the clerk. He could but notice a
blot in one corner of the bill. It was a singular
blot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“It looks like an animal. There is its body,
and those four streaks below would make good
legs for a small animal. Pig, I guess. Now,
I will put that away and attend to my
work,” thought Walter. “Hullo! Who’s calling?
Who’s here at six o’clock?”</p>

<p>Walter noticed that the time by a clock
secured to a post, was very near six o’clock.</p>

<p>Somebody without was apparently shouting
for the storekeeper. Stepping quickly to the
door, Walter noticed first a gaily painted
wagon. Its wheels were scarlet, and its shining
black body was striped with scarlet. He
was about saying to himself, “It’s a young
fellow aboard,” when this same young fellow
lifted a round&ndash;topped felt hat, disclosed a wall
of hair, and shouted, “<i>You</i> here? You don’t
say!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything about it, but I am
glad to see you, Aldrich. What are you up
to?”</p>

<p>“This morning, I am up to bringing my
uncle down here. He is out in the yard, the
barnyard. I am clerking it with him, and shall
be a neighbor of yours this winter; that is, a
mile off, up at the office of my uncle. It is
near the mill you know, that your uncle has put
up for the sawing of the timber round here. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
feller gets a good apprenticeship with Bezaleel
Baggs, I tell you. Oh, he is bright on a trade!
I have learned a good deal by being with him,
already. Say, what kind of a store have you
in there? Most everything, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Walter, who was out on the doorstep, here
turned to the store. The upper part of the
door was of glass, and one who occupied
Walter’s position, could easily see within.</p>

<p>“Is that a man in the store?” thought
Walter. “Is it a man behind the counter?”</p>

<p>He could not make out anything very
distinctly. Besides, Chauncy was calling out
to him, “Look out here, not in there? Do you
expect the Hon. Boardman Blake is in there trading
with himself? That would be handy, for
he could be as sharp as he pleased, or as easy
as he pleased. Really, he is out in the barn,
for I saw him there a moment ago.”</p>

<p>“I thought I noticed somebody in the store,
but I guess it was only a shadow.”</p>

<p>“Come, tell me about your plans,” said
Chauncy, who seemed anxious to catch and
hold Walters attention. “Tell me what you
are up to?”</p>

<p>“Why, I am clerking, am I not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Of course you are. Well, do you
like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>Walter did not answer at once. He could
not rid his mind of the impression that something
was not right in the store. He finally
said, “This is my first morning in the store,”
and was about to add, “I think I shall like
here,” when he chanced to look again into the
store. A golden ray of sunlight, as if an auger,
had bored its way through the shadows behind
the counter, and it fell upon the shelves that
held the Bible and other volumes. In that
light, Walter saw a form, that of a man, though
of no one that he had ever seen before,&mdash;a
short, heavy man, with broad shoulders,
hatless; and was his hair light, or did the sunray
brighten it as it fell upon it? He noticed
that the man’s side whiskers projected into the
sunlight, and also that he leaned over. Walter
was about to lay his hand on the latch of the
door when a terrific yell from Chauncy delayed
him.</p>

<p>“Ah&ndash;hoo! Ah&ndash;hoo!”</p>

<p>Was Chauncy calling to him, or shouting to
somebody in the store that he had already discovered,
and perhaps might wish to notify? If
such a thought came into Walter’s mind, it did
not come clear as a ray of sunshine, but it
was so confused and dim a suspicion that it
made little impression upon him, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
turned one moment as if in obedience to
Chauncy’s call, who was now shouting, “Ah&ndash;hoo&ndash;hoo!
Plymp&ndash;ton!” Then he laughed
heartily: “Ha&ndash;ha! You did not recognize my
Indian yell that I have for folks. See here!
I only wanted to say, if you were going into
the store, and you have any&mdash;any&mdash;any&mdash;”</p>

<p>It took Chauncy some time to tell what he
did want, but fumbling in his pocket, he produced
a ten&ndash;cent piece, and said, “Oh, anything!
Bring me some candy!”</p>

<p>“There is a customer in here, and I’ll bring
it to you quick as I can.”</p>

<p>“Customer, boy! You are demented! I
don’t believe anybody is there, unless it is the
Hon. Boardman, as I said before.”</p>

<p>Chauncy was right. When Walter entered
the store, no one was there! He went behind
the counter, and then he looked under the
counter. The usual row of dumb, unintelligent
soap&ndash;boxes, and spice&ndash;boxes, and candy&ndash;boxes,
could be seen there. He went to the shelves
on which were the books. The sunshine, as
well as the visitor, had mysteriously vanished.
A fly crawling over the books suddenly buzzed
in Walter’s face, as if to ask, in the fly&ndash;tongue,
“What does this fellow want here?”</p>

<p>“If this is not strange!” thought Walter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where did that man go? Am I getting
‘demented,’ as Chauncy said? Could anybody
have gone to the sitting&ndash;room from the
store?”</p>

<p>From the store, one could directly enter the
sitting&ndash;room. Walter hastily looked into the sitting&ndash;room.
The sunray might have retreated
there, and in the rich overflow of light entering
two eastern windows, it certainly would
not have been noticed as a separate ray. But
had the rich, strong flood of light swallowed
up the man, as well as the ray of sunshine?
If he had gone into the sitting&ndash;room, where
was he?</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” thought Walter, for he heard
the cracked voice of Aunt Lydia piping an old
love&ndash;song of her girlhood, as she ironed the
week’s wash in the kitchen opening out of the
sitting&ndash;room. “Nonsense! If anybody had
come here, of course she would have seen them.
She don’t act as if she had seen anybody.” No.
Aunt Lydia was singing in sharp, slender
strains that old love&ndash;ditty, as free from any
agitation as if it had been her uninterrupted
avocation that morning.</p>

<p>“Plympton! Plympton! Where’s that candy?
Have you gone to get your folks to make
that candy?” Chauncy was now calling from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the store door, which he had opened. Walter
returned, went to one of the show&ndash;cases, took
out the quantity of candy ordered, and handed
it to Chauncy.</p>

<p>“The queerest thing!” exclaimed Walter.
“I am sure I saw a man in here; but where
he has gone, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Saw a man!” replied Chauncy, with an incredulous
air. “Nobody has been round here
except you and me. Here’s your uncle up the
road.”</p>

<p>And there indeed Boardman Blake was,
slowly moving along toward the store in his
careless, abstracted way.</p>

<p>“There’s <i>my</i> uncle, and you can see him
down at the fish&ndash;house,” continued Chauncy.
“He would like to find <i>your</i> uncle. That’s
what I brought him down here for. Don’t you
see my uncle?”</p>

<p>The fish&ndash;house was a black little building,
that the rough, strong sea&ndash;winds for the last
twenty&ndash;five years had been trying to push over,
and had partially succeeded. It had been
found necessary to prop it on one side. Here,
the storekeeper accumulated every year a
stock of dried salt fish, purchased of the fishermen
and then sold out to customers from the
surrounding country. Chauncy’s uncle was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
walking about the fish&ndash;house as if trying to
find somebody.</p>

<p>“Is that the man I saw in the store?”
Walter asked.</p>

<p>“Haw&ndash;haw!” laughed Chauncy noisily.
“He’s been down at the fish&ndash;house trying to
hunt up your uncle, all the time I have been
here. Come out and see him, and let’s ask him.”</p>

<p>Walter stepped back to say to Aunt Lydia
that he wanted to go to the fish&ndash;house, and
would be back very soon, and then crossed the
road with Chauncy to the fish&ndash;house.</p>

<p>“The man I saw in the store was sort of
built that way, heavy, and short, and broad at
the shoulders, and was leaning over. I wish
this man would lean over, and let me see how
he looks,” thought Walter. The suspected
party now turned his face to the young men, as
if aware of Walter’s desire to inspect it. It
was a face round and full, flanked with thin,
gray whiskers. One of the eyes had a cast in
it, which gave “Uncle Bezaleel’s” face a certain
crookedness of look; but that does not necessarily
mean crookedness of character. The eyes
of some very honest people have an unfortunate
squint. If though, any one looking at the
upper part of B. Bagg’s face should say, “B.
Baggs is a crooked fellow. Look out!” then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the voice below entirely contradicted that impression.
It was a mild, agreeable voice,
kindly, and rather musical. It had a persuasive
tone, and if the crooked eye was a misfortune,
the voice of which B. Baggs was owner, had
proved to be an excellent piece of property. It
had coaxed many poor fellows on to their ruin.
Its softness, its sympathy, its willingness to
be your friend at any sacrifice, and its great
grief if you possibly could think it was your
enemy, had brought its possessor much money.
It was this voice that had made its way to the
softest place in the soft heart of Boardman
Blake, quicker than the sharpest auger in the
world.</p>

<p>“Uncle, have you been in Mr. Blake’s store
this morning?” inquired Chauncy.</p>

<p>“Why, no, child!” said Uncle Bezaleel in
the most affectionate and bland of tones, at
the same time winking maliciously with his
crooked eye. “What made you think so?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t think so. I knew you had been
out here all the time, trying to hunt up Mr.
Blake; but my friend Plympton here, uncle,
thought you had been in.”</p>

<p>“Ah, how d’ye do, Mr. Plympton,” said Uncle
Bezaleel cordially, addressing Walter by that
title of manhood which goes so straight to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
boy’s heart. Here, with his fat fingers, he softly
squeezed Walter’s hand. “I have been out
here and round somewhat, admiring the tidy
way you and your uncle keep things in. Now
that barnyard looks trim as a dining&ndash;room.
Thrifty as can be, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>The barnyard certainly was very neat for
such a place, but that tired, shabby, leaning
old fish&ndash;house, and the aspect of the place in
general, did not sustain B. Baggs’ wonderful
opinion of thrift. Walter, though, did not like
to mistrust people, and this ready denial, the
soft&ndash;toned compliment also, were irresistible, and
Walter concluded it must have been somebody
else that he saw in the store.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see, sir,” he cried promptly. “It
must have been another man. Excuse me.”</p>

<p>“All&mdash;all right. I must have my little joke,
and I guess you&mdash;you&mdash;ran into your uncle’s
cider barrels, this morning, and couldn’t see
straight.”</p>

<p>“Haw&mdash;haw!” shouted Chauncy.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” laughed Walter. “I don’t imbibe.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, young man. Don’t touch it!
Don’t.”</p>

<p>The crooked eye now gave a funny, wicked
look at Walter, while Chauncy, behind Walter’s
back, executed with his features a look extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
enough to have fitted out a clown for
his performances. Uncle Boardman here arrived,
and the upright, moral B. Baggs, proceeded
at once to confer with him. But who
was it that Walter saw in the store? He intended
to speak at once to his uncle and aunt
about it, but he was sent away to The Harbor,
the fishing village in the neighborhood, and
when he returned, other duties occupied his
mind, and at last, like other matters we neglect,
it went for the present out of his
thoughts altogether.</p>

<p>Aunt Lydia, the evening of this call by Bezaleel
Baggs, had a remark to make to her husband.
They were alone in their sitting&ndash;room,
Aunt Lydia knitting by a little, red, square&ndash;topped
stand, that supported a kerosene lamp.
Uncle Boardman was also sitting near the
table, reading the weekly county paper. He
had a pleasant face, one to which children, and
dogs, and all kinds of dumb animals never made
their appeal in vain. It was benevolent as the
sunlight after three days of cloudy sky. He
may have had brown eyes, but these watchers
of the world had their seat so far under his
bushy eyebrows, like overhanging eaves, that
it was hard to tell their color. When he
looked at another, one saw two soft, shining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
little globes of light directed toward him. As
he always shaved, his big, smooth face had a
certain boy&ndash;look to it. When walking, he had
a way of looking down, carrying his folded
hands before him. He was likely to come in
contact with all sorts of beings and objects;
but no romping child that he collided with, no
big dog bumping against the abstracted pedestrian,
ever heard a testy word of remonstrance
from him. He took kindly a knock from a fish&ndash;barrel,
or a poke from a passing wheel&ndash;barrow.
While people joked about him, everybody respected
and trusted his integrity.</p>

<p>“He’s good salt all the way through,” said
Nahum Caswell, an old fisherman at The
Harbor. “He trusts other folks too much,
and don’t allers know on which side of his
bread the butter is; but then he never takes
other folks’ butter from ’em. You can trust
Boardman with a mint of money, and not a
penny will ketch ’tween his fingers. No, sir.”</p>

<p>If Boardman’s eyes, in their great charity, did
not at once see into a man’s mean motives,
Aunt Lydia’s did, very soon. Her bright, dark
eyes looked deep, and did not look in vain.
Bezaleel Baggs was uneasy the first time he
met her. He felt that a very sharp, clear&ndash;seeing
pair of eyes had fastened upon him a look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that meant inspection, and he avoided her in
every possible way.</p>

<p>“Queer!” exclaimed Aunt Lydia this evening
of our story. “Queer, that Belzebub
Baggs&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Bezaleel,” remonstrated Boardman mildly.</p>

<p>“Wall, he is pizen whatever he is; but isn’t
it queer he don’t like to talk with me? He’ll
buttonhole you by the hour, Boardman, and
palaver and make his soft speeches; but nary a
word does he say to me if he can help it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he has business with me.”</p>

<p>“The snake! I wish he had some with me,
if I wouldn’t jest scorch him.”</p>

<p>Uncle Boardman let out one of his soft,
easy&ndash;natured chuckles, and remarked. “He
probably sees you are a dangerous character.
Ha&mdash;ha!”</p>

<p>“Wall, if he don’t keep away from my winders,
I’ll put some b’ilin’ water on him.”</p>

<p>“Keep away from what? What’s he been
doin’?”</p>

<p>“My advice to him is to keep away from my
winders. There I was this mornin’ at six
o’clock, ironin’ away, and happened to hear a
scratchin’ noise behind me&mdash;you see I was in
the kitchen at the time, and my back was away
from the sittin’&ndash;room&mdash;and I turned sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
quick, and there was that Baggs at the winder
of the sittin’&ndash;room&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Inside?”</p>

<p>“No, outside; and yet it seemed sort of queer.
His head was turned this way, and it seemed
as if he was a slidin’ down outside the clapboards.
I couldn’t make it out what he was a
doin’. For once in his life, he seemed awful
glad to see me, and grinned at me, and really
teched his hat. I don’t want none of his grins
or hat&ndash;techin’s. When he had gone, I went to
this winder, and I found this clingin’ to the
blind. It looks as if it had been torn from a
coat. I jest tucked it in there, because I wasn’t
goin’ upstairs to my rag&ndash;bag then, and knew it
would be safe.”</p>

<p>Every housekeeper is apt to have a “saving
fever,” but its style may vary extensively in
different houses. One housekeeper will carefully
cherish the scraps from the table.
Another husbands the coal. A third burns no
superfluous oil or gas. Another garners all
bits of paper or cloth for the rag&ndash;man; and a
fifth has two eyes out for all possible lessening
of the consumption of butter. Aunt Lydia’s
ambition, was to treasure up every shred of
cloth, all ends of threads, and every slip of
paper. She had put the savings of the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in a little tin box on the mantel, intending
to transfer them to the rag&ndash;bag the next time
she journeyed upstairs.</p>

<p>“A piece of cloth!” said Uncle Boardman,
handling the relic. “Did you think it came
from Baggs’ coat, though I don’t see how? He
wore this morning that blue frock&ndash;coat of his,
with the big, silver buttons.”</p>

<p>“It looks more like a piece of coat&ndash;linin’.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Oh, I guess it’s all right,” said
Uncle Boardman, rising to deposit in the box on
the mantel this mysterious fragment. About
five minutes later, he was wondering if something
were not all wrong. Taking a candle
from the mantel and lighting it, he stepped
into the store. It was very dark, and very still
there, save that the clock was ticking sharply.
The storekeeper passed behind the counter to
the book&ndash;shelf, where Bible and gazetteer,
dictionary and statute&ndash;book, kept one another
company in the dark. He took down the
Bible, laid it on the counter, and then proceeded
to examine it.</p>

<p>“It’s in here somewhere, I know,” he softly
whispered to himself; “for I tucked it away
here, day before yesterday. He inquired for it,
and I told him this morning I would get it,
and send it to&ndash;morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>The desired document was that promise to
pay Bezaleel Baggs five hundred dollars, which
Walter had noticed. It could not now be
found.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s in the Psalms. I read a good
deal there,” thought Uncle Boardman.</p>

<p>Many promises are in the Psalms, but none
to pay B. Baggs five hundred dollars could be
found there.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s in Daniel. I was a lookin’ at
the prophecies there,” thought the bewildered
storekeeper; but the prophet had no such
treasures in his keeping. He now proceeded to
make a thorough and deliberate hunt through
the book. He began at Genesis, and was
patiently turning over the leaves in Proverbs,
when a sharp voice rang out overhead, and then
came in definite tones down through a funnel&ndash;hole
in the ceiling. “You goin’ to bed some
time ’fore the millennium, Boardman?”</p>

<p>It was Aunt Lydia, in her chamber directly
above the store; and she was using a very convenient
substitute for a speaking&ndash;tube; a disused
funnel&ndash;hole that passed through the ceiling of
the store and the floor of Aunt Lydia’s room.
Uncle Boardman started back as if the funnel&ndash;hole
had been the mouth of a cannon, and Aunt
Lydia sent from it a very effective shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Massy!” he exclaimed inwardly. “I
didn’t know she was up there. Comin’, Lydia!”
he shouted. “Comin’ very soon!”</p>

<p>Giving occasional looks at the funnel&ndash;hole as
if to be in readiness to dodge the shot that
might be expected any moment from that
quarter, he hastily completed his investigation
of the Bible. So good a book, though, was unwilling
to promise so untrustworthy a man as
B. Baggs anything without a good assurance
of repentance, and Uncle Boardman, closing
the book, placed it on the book&ndash;shelf again.</p>

<p>“That <i>is</i> queer!” he murmured. “Well, if
anybody found it, the note won’t do ’em any
good, and as for Bezaleel, I can write him
another.”</p>

<p>Taking his candle again, he passed into the
sitting&ndash;room, and then upstairs. It was time
that he did so, for a fluttering of angry steps
around the funnel&ndash;hole showed that Aunt Lydia
was getting ready another and far heavier shot.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pch">STANDING FIRM.</p>

<p>Walter was enjoying a brief furlough at
home in October. He was in his
mother’s sewing&ndash;room that opened out
of the kitchen. It was a little nest that
had room only for a sewing machine, a
table, and two chairs. Walter was now occupying
one of these chairs, and his mother
sat at her table, busily preparing some work
for her nimble little machine. It was a
mild, autumn day, and through the opened
window came the sound of the cricket’s shrill
piping, and the beating of the grain with an
old&ndash;fashioned flail, by Farmer Grant, in his barn
on the opposite side of the road. There was a
crimson&ndash;stained maple near the house, that
suggested to Walter the opening of his conversation
with his mother.</p>

<p>“How soon that maple has turned, mother!”</p>

<p>“Oh no. It is time for it.”</p>

<p>“Let me see. It is not so early for it after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
all. It’s the fifteenth of October. The fifteenth!
Why, that is the day Uncle Boardman
said his mill would be done, and on my way
back, I guess I’ll stop there and see how it
looks.”</p>

<p>“That the mill where his trees are to be
sawed up?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I expect a lot more will come
there. You see uncle built the mill, and Baggs
buys up the timber where he can, and he and
uncle run the mill together, and divide the profits
somehow. But it has cost something to put
that mill up. I know uncle had to borrow
money to do it. I don’t like that Baggs at all,
mother. He took me in at first, he was so soft&ndash;spoken,
but I think I know him now.”</p>

<p>“He has been up in this neighborhood trying
to buy woodland, and wanted your father
to trade with him, but he wouldn’t. We don’t
like his looks up this way.”</p>

<p>There was a lull in the conversation. The
cricket without still kept up his sharp, piercing
song, and Farmer Grant patiently beat out an
accompaniment to the cricket’s tune.</p>

<p>“How long is it now, Walter, since you were
confirmed?”</p>

<p>“Three months, mother.”</p>

<p>“How are you getting along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“Well, mother, I can’t say that I am making
much progress, but I am trying to hold on.”</p>

<p>“Any progress we make in a religious life,
comes from doing just what you say you are
doing, holding on. If we are regular in our
prayers and Bible&ndash;reading, if we patiently attend
to our church duties, and just try from
hour to hour to do our duty to those about us,
that is all one can do. God will do the rest.”</p>

<p>“I had an idea, mother, when I began this
life I should make more progress, get along
faster.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mind that. You must just stick to
your purpose, and keep on. I remember what
Mark Simpson, an old fisherman down at The
Harbor said once. Said Mark,&mdash;‘Going to
heaven is like tryin’ to row round B’ilin’ P’int
when the tide is agin you. If you stick to
your oars, and pull ahead, you’ll come round
all right.’ And I think Mark has shown that,
if any one has. He has had all sorts of troubles,
and he does what he advised, he sticks to his
oars and pulls ahead. There’s a good deal,
Walter, in what I call religious habits; in being
particular about your prayers, in reading your
Bible, in your attendance at church. Get the
wheel down into that track and keep going
steadily, and you will find everything easier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so, mother.”</p>

<p>“And there is one thing which it is well for
us all to know, Walter. It’s the most important
thing. I mean we must get hold of Christ,
understand what He has done for us, what He
will do for us, and holding Him before our eyes
and in our hearts, try to do for Him, and be
like Him. And Walter, there is this thing
I want you to be particular about, to do some
one specific thing for Him. Of course, you try
to live for Him; but I mean a particular duty.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Well, may I speak of something? It sha’n’t
be very hard. Of course, you will go to church
yourself; try to get everybody else you can.
There, do that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will.”</p>

<p>The conversation went on. By and by, his
mother exclaimed, “If it isn’t eleven o’clock!
And there is your lunch, but I will have it
ready soon, and what time do you start?”</p>

<p>“Twelve, in the mail&ndash;wagon, you know. I
go as far as Uncle Boardman’s mill, and I promised
to stop there for Chauncy Aldrich, this
afternoon, while he is away; and then I walk
down to uncle’s at tea&ndash;time. It is not more
than a mile to walk.”</p>

<p>Walter declared the lunch to be “splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>.”
Then there was “a stitch” to be taken in
Walters coat, for which he said he was
“thankful.”</p>

<p>“That does me good,” thought his mother.
“I don’t know as Walter notices it, but since
he has begun his new life, he appreciates more
what his father and mother do for him. It
may seem to be foolish in me, but the religion
that doesn’t come out in little things, won’t come
out in great ones.”</p>

<p>Oh, patient mothers, hard working fathers,
are you “foolish” to be affected by a child’s
gratitude for little things? If children only
knew it, such gratitude makes this a new
world for parents. The mail&ndash;wagon soon rolled
along to the Plympton farm and halted for
Walter. He was passing through the front
yard, hurrying along a lilac and rose&ndash;bordered
path, to the waiting mail&ndash;wagon before the
house, when his mother called out, “Oh,
Walter! Wait a minute.” She ran down the
path.</p>

<p>“I’ll say this for your father, who isn’t at
home. It was his charge, you know when you
were little: ‘Honest, boy.’”</p>

<p>Walter laughed. “I guess I have got all
my bundles now, mother. Good&ndash;bye.”</p>

<p>“Good&ndash;bye, Walter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>As the wagon rattled away, carrying off
Prince Alden, the driver, two mail&ndash;bags, and
two passengers, Walter thought of these words,
“Honest, boy.” It was an expression his
father had used when Walter was a little fellow.
The motto had an influence over Walter, not
only because his father uttered it, but practiced
it. Mr. Plympton’s daily life was the very crystal
of honesty itself; honesty not only shining
through his words but radiant in all his
actions. After a ride of nine miles, came a
group of buildings to which had been recently
given the name “Blake’s Mills.” It was a part
of the business transaction between Bezaleel
Baggs and Walter’s uncle, that the latter should
erect a “tide mill” at the head of “Muskrat
Creek,” a mile from The Harbor. At the
head of this creek, was a large tract of useless
land belonging to Boardman Blake, easily
flooded at high tides. Swinging backward and
forward with the tides, were gates, placed in a
dam that had been thrown across the head of
the creek. Through these opened gates, swept
a strong, clean, cold current from the ocean, at
flood tide, and then the water was distributed
over the low lands, to be held in check until
needed to push the great wheel carrying the
machinery of the mill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you’ll build a mill,” said B. Baggs to
Uncle Boardman, “and run it with me, I’ll
agree to furnish you with logs.”</p>

<p>At one time, for the sake of his “dear friend
Blake,” he talked as if he would build everything,
take all risks and give all profits to that
dear friend.</p>

<p>He did guarantee however, a stated, handsome
income to Boardman. “Then,” he added,
“you can run the mill for corn and flour, if
you wish. However I’ll warrant you on logs
a long, steady job; and it will pay you and me
enough to make a handsome thing out of it.
I’ll furnish logs for five years at least.”</p>

<p>At the same time, he made a great display
of ready money, suggesting untold resources
somewhere. He bought up the trees on extensive
tracts of woodland far and near. Wherever
he went, an immense business movement
seemed to go with him. Uncle Boardman was
bewildered. This great being, like a big oceancraft,
bore down on him with such an imposing
spread of financial sail, that he and his,&mdash;all but
Aunt Lydia&mdash;were easy captures. Boardman
built the mill, although he was forced to borrow
five hundred dollars of Baggs that he might
accomplish this. It was a note for this amount
which Walter had stumbled upon and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
his uncle had subsequently missed, but to cover
the debt, he had written and tendered another.
It is true that logs had not come to the mill so
freely as Baggs had prophesied, for even logs
need a little pushing to accomplish a journey;
and Uncle Boardman’s receipts were not so
large that the disposition of them had perplexed
him. It was a fact also that some people
had begun to label the mill “Boardman’s
Folly;” but Bezaleel Baggs could furnish any
amount of palaver, even if he could not make
trees cut themselves down, and roll in large
numbers to the mill; and his softly padded
tongue kept Uncle Boardman quiet. Chauncy
Aldrich represented his uncle’s interests at the
mill, as that relative was often absent on mysterious
journeys, from which he returned with
an air of vast importance; as if he had bought
up half the world to&ndash;day, and it would be delivered
at ‘Blake’s Mills’ to&ndash;morrow. In connection
with Baggs’ “office,” a small, ragged, unpainted
shanty, there was a “store” to supply
the hands at the mill. Uncle Boardman had
stocked this emporium, and Baggs sold the
goods on commission. Uncle Boardman sometimes
thought that his profits were exceedingly
small; though he knew that his “branch
store,” as Baggs had pretentiously named it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
could have very few customers. Some people
had rashly asserted that liquor was sold at this
store, but as a town&ndash;law forbade it, and as
Boardman Blake’s principles forbade it also,
the sale of liquor did not seem probable. For
all that, something “mysterious” was sold
there. It was at this “branch store” that
Walter expected to serve, the afternoon of his
return from his parents, as Chauncy wished to
be away. The mail&ndash;wagon deposited Walter
at the mill, and then clattered away. The mill
was not running, as it was flood tide; and the
water was rushing in from the sea, storing up
the power that made all mill&ndash;running possible.
No one seemed to be in the great barn&ndash;like mill,
and few logs were accumulated there to feed
the hungry saws when their sharp teeth might
be set in motion.</p>

<p>“It looks quiet,” thought Walter.</p>

<p>It certainly was quiet in the big, deserted mill;
in the narrow little road without; in the adjoining
fields, so level and green; in the sky above,
through which the sunshine was silently
poured down. Nothing seemed to be stirring
save the tide, racing up “Muskrat Creek,” and
that went with an almost intelligent sound. As
it rushed, and eddied, and gurgled, it seemed to
say, “On hand, Boardman! We’ll start that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
lazy mill, shortly.” Ah, there was one other
object stirring, at the office, store, shanty door,
and this was Chauncy. He looked out into the
road, then up to the sky, and then over toward
the mill, as if he expected an arrival from some
quarter.</p>

<p>“Ha, Plympton!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Here I am,” replied Walter. “Am I late,
Aldrich?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, but this is one of the days when the
market seems to be paralyzed. Haven’t had a
customer, and not a log has been hauled to the
mill. However, Uncle Baggs is off stirring ’em
up somewhere, and trade will begin to move
this way. He is a master hand to stir people
up and there will be a movement soon.”</p>

<p>Here he shoved back his cap, and showed
that bristling wall of hair behind which he
seemed to be entrenched, and from that impregnable
position was defying all the world. His
air was that of a challenge to Walter to “come
on” if he dared, and show that Bezaleel
Baggs would not “stir people up”; yes, “stir
’em up,” and bring on an immense movement
in “the market.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Walter, dropping his traveling
bag, “if there is little to be done, I can get a
chance to read a book I have in my bag. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
long do you want to be away? Suit yourself,
you know. I am here to accommodate you,
and sha’n’t be needed at my uncle’s before six.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will be back by five. Besides, my
uncle may come, and he will relieve you. He
is a great hand to drop on folks sort of
unexpected.”</p>

<p>“Well, when he drops, I don’t want to be exactly
under him, for he looks like solid weight.”</p>

<p>“Ha&mdash;ha! When Uncle Bezaleel <i>does</i> come
down on a man, he can drop heavy. Well,
good&ndash;bye and good luck to you.”</p>

<p>Off swaggered Chauncy, his cap at one side
of his head; his whole air that of some bragging
money king, who had sallied forth to upset
“the market” in behalf of himself; or to accomplish
some other great feat of financial
tumbling. Walter was left alone in the office.
For awhile, he read a recent report of the life
saving service; for the world that centered in
the little building whose outlook and flags&ndash;taff
he could see from Uncle Boardman’s storedoor,
interested him exceedingly. Nobody
appeared to interrupt him save a fly, that
buzzed up to him vigorously, in Chauncy’s
style, but buzzed back immediately at a wave
of the hand, which was <i>not</i> Chauncy’s style.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Walter, after an hour’s fascinating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
reading, “I hear a footstep. Somebody’s coming.
A customer, probably.”</p>

<p>He let his book drop on the counter, and
awaited this arrival. A young man entered,
whom Walter thought he had seen before; but
where, he could not readily say.</p>

<p>“He is not over twenty&ndash;one,” thought Walter.
“He has a nice form.”</p>

<p>The young man had a frame of much symmetry,
and the dress&ndash;coat that he wore, instead
of the loose blouse common among the fishermen
and farmers, brought out into distinct outline
his well&ndash;shaped figure. Although his look
was that of a rather strong excitement, which
flushed his face, and gave it an unnatural
eagerness, yet Walter was attracted toward him
at once. A little girl, who bore some resemblance
to the young man, closely followed
him, clinging to the skirt of his coat. The
young man appeared to be looking for something
on one of the shelves, and with a twinkle
of his blue eyes, and in musical, ringing tones,
he called out, “In some stores, they say on a
card, ‘If you don’t see a thing, ask for it.’”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Walter, “Ask away. I
would like to sell something to somebody.”</p>

<p>The young man did not lower his eyes to
notice Walter, but continued to search with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
them the objects on the three shelves behind
the counter.</p>

<p>“He can’t want soap, or matches, or that pile
of mittens for fishermen,” thought Walter.</p>

<p>The young man, himself, here expressed his
wants.</p>

<p>“See here!” he said in a half&ndash;whisper, leaning
forward. “Where’s that big bottle Baggs
keeps on the upper shelf, generally behind a
bundle of yarn?”</p>

<p>As he leaned forward, Walter noticed by his
breath that he had been drinking an intoxicant
of some kind. He noticed also that the little girl
in the rear was now tugging at his coat, as if to
pull him back from an exposed position. Did
the child say, “Don’t!”</p>

<p>“Go way, Amy! Don’t pull so!” exclaimed
the young man rather testily. Still he did not
look round at this interferer, and he did not
even glance at Walter. His eager eyes were
fastened on those generally uninteresting
objects, soap, yarn, and matches. Surely, there
could be no snake’s eye up there to bewilder
one.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see the top of it! Just above that
big lot of yarn on the third shelf. That’s how
I made my mistake&mdash;I was looking at the
second shelf, you see, and&mdash;and it’s the third&mdash;don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Amy! Keep quiet, Amy! There, if
you’ll just get that down! A&mdash;my, stop!”</p>

<p>Was it a big sob, Walter heard behind this
customer? The young man’s look was no
more eager now than Walter’s. The desire to
know, was as strong in the latter, as appetite
was in the former, and Walter had now
mounted a rickety, flag&ndash;bottomed chair, and
was pulling aside the packages on the shelves.
Reaching a big bundle of yarn on the uppermost
shelf, he saw the object of the young
man’s intense desire; an immense black bottle
with an immense black stopper.</p>

<p>“There&mdash;there she is! Just hand her down;
and if you have any water handy, I’ll mix it
myself, you know. Amy, you stop pulling, or
I’ll send you outdoors.”</p>

<p>The young man’s voice, though earnest, was
not cross. Indeed, he had endured a constant
twitching from his small companion.</p>

<p>“Just hand her down, please.”</p>

<p>“Well, no, I think not, if it is liquor,” was
Walter’s reply.</p>

<p>This, to the young man, was an unexpected
turn of affairs. For the first time, he now
looked directly at Walter. Still, he stayed
good&ndash;natured, and that attracted Walter the
more strongly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;of course it is liquor. You
don’t suppose Baggs would hide kerosene, say,
behind his mothy old yarn, would he?” and
the young man laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, no, I should say not,” and Walter
laughed also.</p>

<p>“You are here to sell, are you not?” asked
the young man.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose I am, for the afternoon; but
I didn’t agree to sell everything Baggs might
put into this old hole. I don’t know what your
business is, though your face looks natural;
but if the man that employed you, say to
catch fish, should say some day, ‘There goes
somebody’s sheep in the road. I am going to
shear it, and keep the wool, and I want you
to hold it, for I hired you to work for me,’ I
guess you would let your fingers burn first, before
you would touch the thing that was another
man’s.” There was silence now in the
little shanty. The young man began to drum
on the counter with his fingers.</p>

<p>“Then, it is against the law to sell liquor in
this town,” observed Walter.</p>

<p>“Oh, Baggs is cute to fix that,” replied the
would&ndash;be customer in a whisper. “You need not
take any money now. Baggs <i>gives</i> us a glass
of liquor to&ndash;day, and in a week from to&ndash;day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
when we meet him, we say, ‘A present, Mr.
Baggs,’ and we <i>give</i> him money enough to
cover the worth of the liquor.”</p>

<p>The young man was no longer looking at
Walter, but at the bottle on the shelf, as if addressing
that.</p>

<p>“I should think,” said Walter, indignantly,
“the devil himself would be ashamed of that
mean, underhanded way. I believe in being
aboveboard and honest. No, I am not going
to have anything to do with this business,” and
as he spoke, he very resolutely thrust back the
yarn, hiding the bottle from the observation of
all save those to whose sight their appetite
gave unusual keenness. While he was doing
this, he heard a noise at the door. It was only
a slight stir at first, as of a lively brush from
the wind pushing its way past the door. It
was just such a “lively” effort of the wind, as
at sea, may grow into a hurricane. Turning
toward the door, Walter saw Baggs. It was
Baggs indeed, and nobody else, but oh, what
a change!</p>

<p>“Well, sir!” he roared.</p>

<p>How unlike that smooth&ndash;speaking, mild&ndash;tempered
man, who usually went by the name
of Baggs! His face was ruffled and darkened
with rage. His skin seemed to be blown out;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and as certain unnoticed pimples had grown
also, it had a mottled, puffy look, like that of a
frog. In the midst of this turgidity and discoloration,
his twisted eye flashed and wriggled
in a frightful manner, while his voice was
hoarse and blatant as that of a fog&ndash;horn.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you are a pretty&mdash;feller&mdash;in&mdash;in
this store! Git&mdash;git&mdash;out of this!” he shouted,
catching his breath.</p>

<p>As his peculiarity of sight made it difficult
to always tell whom he might be looking at,
both the young men glanced doubtfully at
Baggs, and then inquiringly at one another; as
if about to say, “Whom does he mean?”</p>

<p>“Git&mdash;git&mdash;out!” he roared again.</p>

<p>“Who&mdash;o&mdash;o?” asked the young man outside
the counter.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you&mdash;<i>you</i>!” said Baggs, with tremendous
emphasis, advancing toward the young
man inside the counter. “I mean <i>you</i>, Walter
Plympton. I&mdash;I&mdash;have heard your&mdash;talk&mdash;talk&mdash;for
the last five minutes. I mean <i>you</i>,
sir, whose&mdash;whose uncle I have been striving&mdash;ving&mdash;to
exalt to the&mdash;the&mdash;pin&mdash;pin&mdash;<i>nack</i>&mdash;ul
of untold wealth. I mean <i>you</i>, an ungrateful
neph&mdash;neph&mdash;ew. I mean <i>you</i>, who wouldn’t
give to a fellow&mdash;that’s&mdash;that’s faint&mdash;a little
sip&mdash;sip that would do him no harm. Will the&mdash;law&mdash;law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
stop that work of&mdash;mer&mdash;mercy to
the sick? You were not&mdash;asked&mdash;as I understand&mdash;it&mdash;to
sell, but simp&mdash;simply to put&mdash;as
I understand it&mdash;the bottle <i>here</i>.”</p>

<p>With new and frightful energy, Baggs here
pounded the counter, which he had struck several
times before.</p>

<p>“You were not asked&mdash;asked&mdash;to do anything
more. Will you&mdash;you not&mdash;befriend the&mdash;the&mdash;”</p>

<p>Although Baggs’ philanthropy did not fail
him, and he could have talked an hour as the
champion of the faint and weary, yet his breath
<i>did</i> desert him; and he stood there, gasping,
“the&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;”</p>

<p>Baggs had a great reputation as orator at
town meetings, and he was declared by admirers
“always to be equal to the occasion,”
and it was mortifying now to be found so unequal
to this emergency. There was no help
for it, though. He could only gasp, “the&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh well,” remarked Walter, “I can go as
well now, as any time. When you catch me
selling liquor, you will be likely to find at the
same time the Atlantic full of your mill&ndash;logs.
Good&ndash;day, sir.”</p>

<p>This reference to Baggs’ logs, which were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
numerous enough that day to fill anything, so
affected the orator, that he did succeed in making
a new forensic effort.</p>

<p>“Go, boy!” he thundered.</p>

<p>The next moment, Walter was rushing out
of the door, as indignant on the side of the
clerk, as Baggs was on the side of the employer.</p>

<p>“Such impudence!” exclaimed Baggs, his
wrath slowly subsiding. “If you don’t feel
just right, I’ll ’tend to you,” he said to the
customer. “I’ll trouble you to get down that
bottle.”</p>

<p>The young man did not stir. He seemed to
be in a stupor.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Baggs. “Feel
wuss?” and a sarcastic humor lighted up his
twisted eye.</p>

<p>“I’m going,” said the young man.</p>

<p>“And not take a drink?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve seen enough of it. That young
fellow is right in not selling, and if he can’t sell,
I won’t be fool enough to drink.”</p>

<p>“Come, come!” said a little voice behind him.</p>

<p>“Yes, Amy; I’m going,” and out of the store
he went. Baggs was amazed. He could not
understand it.</p>

<p>“Well, if that ain’t queer!” he muttered.
He began to wonder if the recent scene were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
real, whether it might not have been a dream.
There was Walter, though, now almost out of
sight; and the young man was moving in the
same direction, his coat&ndash;skirts still clutched by
Amy. These three were substantial witnesses
to the reality of the affair; and Baggs, wiping
his forehead with a very red, and a very dirty
handkerchief, turned toward his desk in what
was strictly the “office” part of the shanty.</p>

<p>Walter did not intend to take the road he
was now traveling, but when he left Baggs, he
was feeling so intensely, that the matter of a
road was too trivial to be noticed. The road
in which he was walking led him to The Harbor;
and from this village, he could reach his
uncle’s, though his walk would be a long one.</p>

<p>“I have started,” he reflected, “and I might
as well keep on. Besides, if I turn back to take
the right road, I shall have to pass Baggs’
office, and I don’t want to go near that rascal.
I will walk a mile to avoid him.” He tramped
forward with a kind of fierce energy, busily
thinking.</p>

<p>“The idea! Wanting to exalt Uncle Boardman
to a pinnacle of wealth! And he has
been constantly befooling him. He has been
pretending to buy up woodland far and near;
and I don’t know but that he has bought it, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
one way, but I don’t believe he has paid for it.
Aunt Lydia saw through him all the time, and
she was the sharpest of the lot. Then that
liquor business! Wasn’t he cunning, giving
away his whiskey! Well, he found one person
who would neither sell, nor give for him.”</p>

<p>So intensely was Walter thinking, he did not
notice how rapidly he was passing through the
little fishing&ndash;village. There were not more
than forty houses at The Harbor, and these
were located anywhere along the crooked line
of the one narrow street. The neighborhood
was very rocky, and in and out among the
ledges, wound this single street. Some of the
houses were very old, and their roofs were
patched with moss. Planted near the ledges,
these ancient relics of domestic architecture
seemed more like masses of lichen, that had
fastened on the ledges, becoming a part of
them; and resolute to maintain their rocky
anchorage as long as the rough sea winds, and
the driving rains, would let them. The village
had a small store, whose proprietor considered
himself as a dangerous competitor of Boardman
Blake, and a box schoolhouse, capped with a
rude little belfry, which never had entertained
a bell as its guest. It had also an unpainted
“hall,” where one evening a dance might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
pounded out by the vigorous feet of the young
men and women of the village; the next evening
might witness an auction; and if the
third evening belonged to Sunday, some kind
of a religious service might be held there.
These three public buildings, the store, the
schoolhouse, the hall, Walter had passed.
Chancing to look up, he said, “I am almost
through the village. I have been so mad, I
have made pretty quick time; and there is the
road that goes up to Uncle Boardman’s; and&mdash;and&mdash;there’s
the ‘Crescent’! I have a great
mind to go home that way, by the Crescent.”</p>

<p>The Crescent was a peculiarity of rock and
sand in the harbor. If it had been simply a
shoal of sand, though shaped like a young
moon this year, the shifting tides every day,
the great storms of spring or autumn, would
have worked it over into something very unlike
a young moon another year. There were nubs
of rocks at either end, and ledges were scattered
along the sides of this marine scimeter,
so that a measure of the restless sand was retained;
and year after year, the Crescent
kept substantially its form.</p>

<p>At low tide, the Crescent could be easily
reached by any pedestrian. One in passing
from The Harbor to Boardman Blake’s, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
leave the road, and at low tide cross over to
the Crescent, pass along its ledges and sand,
and leaving it, at its easterly extremity, regain
the land without wetting the feet. This
course would carry one not far from the lane
that straggled from the life saving station up
to Boardman Blake’s; and although a much
longer route than by the road, it had its attractions
for those who liked to see the surf tumble
on the rocks. Walter was of this number, and
instead of following any farther the crooked
street that wound among the ledges, and then
curved toward Boardman Blake’s store, he
digressed at a point opposite the Crescent;
and he took the longer, but more romantic way
home.</p>

<p>“I will cross to those rocks half way down
the Crescent, and sit down a while and watch
the waves break over the rocks,” he said.
“Splendid place there.”</p>

<p>It was a tempting outlook upon the somersets
thrown by those acrobats of the ocean, the
waves, when they reached the rocky line of the
shore, and there made tumble after tumble.
Walter sat a long time watching and thinking:</p>

<p>“Then I have run against Baggs,” he said,
“and I didn’t anticipate that. Wasn’t he mad!
I never thought that smooth&ndash;talking man could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
rave like one of these waves. I am sorry for
Uncle Boardman’s sake, for I imagine&mdash;poor
man&mdash;he has enough to worry him, and my
fuss with Baggs may make him some trouble.
But I don’t see what else I could have done.
That fellow&mdash;I wonder where I have seen him&mdash;had
been drinking already, and a glass or
two more might have just finished him. I
could not do that; no, not even set down the
bottle for him. And the law was against it;
and I could not in any way help break the
law. Baggs could not ask it of me, for I didn’t
go there for any such purpose. No, sir! I
think I did the right thing, and I’ll stick to it,
and stand by it.”</p>

<p>In his earnestness, Walter rose, stamped on the
ledges with his feet, as if to give emphasis to
his opinion, and looked off on the wide ocean
of blue, whose play was as restless as that of his
thoughts. And as he looked, somehow it
seemed to him as if he had the sympathy of
that wide reach of nature he was watching.
The sky seemed to bend down to him in an
approval which the gently blowing wind whispered,
and that great ocean had a voice, sounding
in the thousands of waves pressing toward
him, and saying in the roar of the surf, “You are
right.” This secret sympathy between law in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
nature and its keeper in the sphere of principle,
is one of the rewards of right&ndash;doing. And
above all, in his heart, Walter had the sense of
satisfaction whose source he knew to be God.
He did not know what might be the personal
consequences of his difficulty with Baggs, but
he felt that he was right; and he could plant
his feet on that assurance solid as the ledges
under him. He remained a long time watching
the waves, till he was startled to see what
a protracted shadow his form threw on the
black ledges.</p>

<p>“Sun is getting low,” he said. “I must be
going.”</p>

<p>He turned, and moved away a short distance,
when he turned again, and looked back upon
the rocks he had left.</p>

<p>“That is strange,” he said.</p>

<p>He noticed that this particular ledge, called
the “Center Rock” by the fishermen, had a
divided summit. The outline of the eastern
half of this summit was curiously like that of a
chair; as if placed there in anticipation of an
arrival by sea. No one, though, came out of
the great, empty waste of water, now rapidly
blackening in the twilight.</p>

<p>“Sort of funny,” he exclaimed, and hurried
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ho, what is this?” he asked. Looking toward
the land, he noticed that while he had
been watching the waves, the tide had turned,
and covered the low, sandy flats with a floor of
crystal.</p>

<p>“Well, it is not so very deep, and I can wade
ashore,” said Walter. He was untying his
shoes, when he heard the noise of oars. As he
chanced to look up to see who might be coming,
the boatman turned, and resting on his
oars, faced Walter. A smile as from an old
acquaintance overspread his features, and he
called out, “Hold on there!”</p>

<p>A few more strokes, and the boat was on the
sand at Walter’s feet.</p>

<p>“One good turn deserves another,” cried the
boatman. “Jump in!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that you?” cried Walter. “Well, I will.”
And into the boat he jumped.</p>

<p>This opportune arrival was the young man
he had met in Baggs’ store that afternoon. He
was dressed now for work, and wore a blue
blouse. It could not hide, though, his broad
shoulders, and when he rowed, one could but
admire the easy, strong sweep of the arms.</p>

<p>“I was busy watching the waves,” explained
Walter, “and I did not notice that the tide had
turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“You would have crossed without much difficulty
to the shore, though in three hours from
this time you might have done some swimming.”</p>

<p>“I am good for that.”</p>

<p>“Dare say. You would have got along,
though they do tell some boogerish stories
about those rocks. Did you notice the ‘Chair’?
It is on the easterly side of what we call the
‘Center Rock.’”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I saw that.”</p>

<p>“Well, they say a young girl was caught on
the Crescent by the tide toward night, and a
rain and fog set in. Oh, it was years ago, and
we had no station here; and it was when the
men folks used to go off fishing down to
Banks&mdash;the Newfoundland&mdash;and of course there
were few folks at home. I mean men folks.
Some of the women thought they heard screams
in the night; but then in a storm, the waves
keep up such a pounding, you can hardly hear
your own ears. The storm got worse all that
night, and in the morning, it was bad enough
outside the Crescent. Soon as the storm
would let them cross over, some of the people
went, they say; but they didn’t find the girl.”</p>

<p>“Well, how did they know she stayed there?
Perhaps she went somewhere else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“They never heard of her anywhere else;
and that reminds me of something I didn’t put
in. There was a fishing&ndash;sloop running along
the shore, and made harbor here. It passed by
the Crescent in the afternoon, and the skipper
saw a girl sitting in what we call the Chair,
on the ocean side of Center Rock. That was
the last seen of her, and the weather had not
set in rainy then. Oh, I have heard my mother
tell the story many times; and what was queer,
there was a boy mixed up with the affair,&mdash;the
girl’s brother. My mother used to say that
the boy and girl had had some quarrel, and he
asked her to go over to Center Rock and see
a curious chair there, knowing of course that the
tide would turn and bother her. I think he led
her there, and left her there. I don’t know as
he intended anything so serious as her drowning,
but he was mad, and meant to punish her
enough to frighten her. But it set in raining,
and the fog you know is bewildering; and
then the storm was pretty bad that night, and
the waves wash clear over Center Rock in a
storm. Then my mother used to say&mdash;my
mother is not living now&mdash;the girl was a
stranger here, and didn’t know what the Chair
might do for one. She and her brother were
visiting here, I believe; and isn’t it singular that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
their name should have been Baggs? Not
singular that I know of, only we had something
to do with somebody of the same
name this afternoon, and one thing suggests
another.”</p>

<p>The young man here rested on his oars, and
looking into Walter’s face, said: “You did a
good thing for me, this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I am glad if I did.”</p>

<p>“What I call ‘the craze’ was on me then. I
had one glass, and that is always enough to
start me, and I thought I must have more. It
was strong, you know, and I can’t touch the
stuff safely. It’s too powerful for me. Our talk
though, gave me a chance to think; and when
Baggs came, I surprised him by refusing it,&mdash;he
offered it to me, you see. Then I went home,
and my sister&mdash;she is as good as she can be&mdash;gave
me a hot supper and some coffee, and I am
all right now.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. I expect Baggs will want to
pitch into me.”</p>

<p>“No, he won’t. He knows that I know
something about his style of handling that
bottle, and I think that will hold him back. I
believe that he will be very glad to keep on
the right side of you. If he don’t, he will get
on the wrong side of me. Baggs is a coward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
He can blow and bluster worse than a nor’easter,
but he is a coward at the end of it.”</p>

<p>“He must stop, though, his liquor business.
If nothing more, it will get my uncle into
trouble. You see he owns the goods in&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Does he? I didn’t know that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he owns what is in that pen.”</p>

<p>“Though not the pig, or the two pigs, I
should say; counting in that precious nephew of
Baggs’. Ha&ndash;ha!”</p>

<p>“That selling, or giving, will give my uncle a
bad name.”</p>

<p>“I see, I see, for it will come out and every
body know it, sooner or later, of course.”</p>

<p>“As for the liquor business itself, I won’t
have anything to do with it.”</p>

<p>“You are right, I know; and I want to do the
right thing myself. I mean to do right, and I
have just promised my sister I would try
again.”</p>

<p>“Ask God to help you,” said Walter in a
hearty, boy&ndash;fashion.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I suppose I ought. But here we
are ashore, and sooner than I thought for.”</p>

<p>The boat was in a little sand&ndash;cove where, affected
by the Crescent, the roll of the surf
was very gentle.</p>

<p>“You go up to your uncle’s, I s’pose, and I go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to the life saving station. I am one of the
crew there, and it was my turn to be off to&ndash;day.”</p>

<p>“There! I thought I had seen you somewhere
before.”</p>

<p>“I have seen you there, and you would have
known me quicker, perhaps, if I hadn’t shaved
off my beard. That alters me somewhat.”</p>

<p>“But it seems to me as if I had seen you before
I came this way.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder. People meet, you know,
under queer circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Hullo, Woodbury,” called out a man
dressed like a fisherman, and waiting on the
rocks above the strip of sand. “I’ve been here
a&ndash;waitin’, some time.”</p>

<p>“Then his name is Woodbury,” thought
Walter. “I know that much.”</p>

<p>The fisherman sprang into the boat vacated
by Woodbury and Walter, and thrusting his
oar into the sand, pushed off at once. Woodbury
went to the left toward the station, while
Walter took the lane to his uncle’s.</p>

<p>“I am very much surprised to know that Mr.
Baggs would do anything of the kind,” said
Uncle Boardman in his slow, meditative way,
when Walter after supper related the affair of
the day. Uncle Boardman, as he spoke, worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
his fingers nervously, as if they were pencils,
with which he was working out a problem on a
slate.</p>

<p>“Sur&ndash;<i>prised</i>, Boardman?” inquired Aunt
Lydia, thrusting forward her sharp features.
“You sur&ndash;<i>prised</i>? I am not. I don’t think there
is anything that mean critter won’t be up to,
or down to, rather. I ventur’ to say there’s been
queer carryin’s on, if we only knew.” And Aunt
Lydia’s sharp face suggested the beak of a bird
that was after its prey; and woe be to that
worm, the unhappy Baggs, if once before the
beak!</p>

<p>“I thought I ought to speak of the matter,”
said Walter apologetically. “I hate anything
that looks like telling, but I knew you owned
the goods up there in Baggs’ place, and you
might be involved in trouble.”</p>

<p>“Walter, don’t you ’polergize one bit. I
shan’t take it, if Boardman does. That mean
critter don’t deserve nary a ’polergy.”</p>

<p>“Jingle, jingle!” went the warning bell in
the store.</p>

<p>“I will go, uncle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Somebody may want me.” When
Uncle Boardman returned, he remarked, “I
thought as much. It was&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Baggs?” said Aunt Lydia eagerly guessing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and I thought there must be some
extenuating circumstances. He brought it in
while we were talking together, saying he had
had occasion to give a little liquor to some of
the fishermen when sick and faint, and he allowed
that he might have been mistaken, in
other cases.”</p>

<p>“Why should he receive presents of money
afterwards, and why not take it at the time, if
everything was all right, uncle?”</p>

<p>“Now, Boardman, you mean to be charitable,”
ejaculated Aunt Lydia, “and it says charity
shall hide a multitude of sins, but sich a big sinner,
you can’t kiver him up. His sins <i>will</i> stick
out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, Lydia, I only mean to say what
can be said for him, and he allows he hasn’t
always done just right, but he promises to
stop.”</p>

<p>“But what will the poor, sick, faint fishermen
do?” inquired Aunt Lydia solicitously, and
in a sarcastic tone.</p>

<p>Uncle Boardman, though, had taken a candlestick
from the mantel&ndash;piece, had lighted a long
specimen of tallow manufacture, by Aunt Lydia,
and was passing out of the door that led upstairs
to his chamber.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess,” said Uncle Boardman good&ndash;naturedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
laughing, “we will send ’em round
to you. I don’t know of a better hand to take
care of tramps and paupers.”</p>

<p>Aunt Lydia had a peculiarity, and that was
the indiscriminate relief of everybody who might
ask for her charity. In that way, she had nourished
some very deserving souls, behind the
pitiful looks and shabby garments pleading at
her door, and she had also nourished some who
were not so deserving, but were frauds of the
worst kind.</p>

<p>The tallow candle carried by Uncle Boardman
had now withdrawn its diminutive rays, and
his footsteps had ceased sounding on the uncarpeted
stairway leading to the second
story.</p>

<p>“There,” declared Aunt Lydia, “if that man
wasn’t a saint, I wouldn’t take folks’ heads off
like that ere Baggs’. There, they do set right
down on him; and it jest riles me.”</p>

<p>“Aunt,” inquired Walter, “did you ever hear
about an accident at the Chair, on the Crescent,
when it was said a girl went there, and
the tide cut her off from the land?”</p>

<p>“A storm comin’ up that night?”</p>

<p>“That’s the time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, only it happened thirty years ago.
But, Walter&mdash;” and Aunt Lydia looked at him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
with her sharp, black eyes&mdash;“though it was so
long since, I can see that ere gal now.”</p>

<p>“Did you see her?”</p>

<p>“Of course. She went by our winders right
down that ’ere road. Poor thing! She never
came back.”</p>

<p>“What was it her brother did?”</p>

<p>“Why, they was a&ndash;visitin’ here, and they had
some quarrel, and he urged her to go there, they
said, and he met her beyond the house and
went with her. Then, they said, he left her
there on purpose&mdash;told her suthin’ to keep her
there, I s’pose&mdash;and she didn’t know ’bout the
tides, and was caught. I b’lieve he ’lowed to
somebody arterwards that he hadn’t done jest
right.”</p>

<p>“Was his name Baggs?”</p>

<p>“Bagster.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">AT THE STATION.</p>

<p>Walter was at the life saving station
looking up a stairway leading from
the crew’s room to an open scuttle
in the roof. If Walter had put his head out
of the scuttle, he would have seen a railing,
hemming in a small platform; and from its
center, rose a modest flag&ndash;staff. There was no
chance though for explorations, as the way was
entirely blocked. On the stairway, Walter saw
an immense pair of boots, and above them a
stout pair of legs; and then a man’s bulky body,
roofed by a huge “sou’wester.”</p>

<p>“No room for me to pass there,” thought
Walter.</p>

<p>The man held in his hand the object that at
a life saving station comes under the head,
“marine glasses.”</p>

<p>“Do you see anything?” asked Walter recognizing
the man to be Tom Walker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Only a fishin’ smack, and a mean one at
that. It’s my watch, you know.”</p>

<p>The boots, the legs, the big body, and the
sou’wester all came down.</p>

<p>“Step up if you want to, Walter.”</p>

<p>Climbing the stairway, Walter swept the sea
with his bright eyes, and then looked landward
across the black rocks and the fading fields.
Then he turned toward the sea again. Off in
the east was the fishing smack, slowly sailing
in the sun. Then he looked up at the flag&ndash;staff,
which carried some specimen of marine architecture
on its top.</p>

<p>“I see two craft,” said Walter.</p>

<p>“Two?” inquired Tom, solicitously.</p>

<p>“The fishing smack and this on top of the
staff.”</p>

<p>“Ho&mdash;ho!” roared Tom.</p>

<p>“Only I can’t make out this second one in
the air.”</p>

<p>“It <i>was</i> a brig, but the last gale we had
tore away its rigging, and made some improvements;
and I don’t know what on airth or water
to call that thing. I guess she is ’phibious, and
will go on either.”</p>

<p>Walter’s eager eyes caught a glimpse of a
box, on a landing half way up the stairway to
the lookout, and from this box projected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
bundles of cloth, here and there showing bits
of color.</p>

<p>“That is the signal box?” remarked Walter.</p>

<p>“Yes. Sometime I will explain them to
you.”</p>

<p>“Will you?” inquired Walter, his hazel eyes
snapping at the prospect of this new continent
of knowledge,&mdash;the signal department of the
life saving service.</p>

<p>“Sartin. Give you a hint now. For instance,
we have a pennant, a triangular flag, blue, with
a white ball in it; and if I h’ist it, it would
mean ‘no’ to some question asked by a vessel
off shore signaling to me. Or, s’posin’ I h’isted
a white pennant with a red ball. That would
mean ‘yes.’”</p>

<p>Walter desired to overhaul that unpretending
box at once, but he knew he must return
to the store; and he only remarked, “I
would like to see all those signals out sometime.”</p>

<p>“I guess you can without any doubt. You
take a good deal of interest in our station,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. It is something entirely new to
me.”</p>

<p>“You would make a pretty good surfman,”
said Tom, glancing approvingly at Walter’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
compact frame. “Woodbury Elliott says you
row a pretty good stroke.”</p>

<p>“Oh! That his name? I came in his boat
from the Crescent the other night.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tom deliberately, looking at
Walter’s frame as if he were a recruiting officer
examining the physical points of a candidate
for the ranks of Uncle Sam’s army. “I think, I
think&mdash;you would do.”</p>

<p>Walter laughed. “I guess I must be a storekeeper.
However, I am pleased if you think
I have strength enough for a surfman.”</p>

<p>Tom now turned away, and with his glass
swept the misty horizon again.</p>

<p>“There is the fishin’ smack,” he said. “And
hullo! What’s that? I missed her afore,
sartin.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“She’s a fore&ndash;and&ndash;aft, sure as you are born;
and&mdash;and&mdash;it is a coaster, and she’s headin’ this
way. Queer I missed her.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see her. Uncle Boardman is expecting
a coaster to come after a load of
potatoes. I wonder if that’s the one!”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder one bit. It’s hazy
where she is, and that’s the reason we didn’t
see her.”</p>

<p>“I think I had better report that to uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” remarked the surfman, pointing
his glass again at the schooner. “She may go
somewhere else, but she acts to me as if she
wanted to run in at The Harbor.”</p>

<p>“I think I will tell Uncle Boardman.”</p>

<p>“What does she bring here, if it’s bound
here for your uncle’s potatoes?”</p>

<p>“I believe she brings a variety of things;
some groceries for the store, some salt for the
fishermen, and so on. Her cargo is what they
call miscellaneous.”</p>

<p>It was not long before a coasting schooner
was beating off the mouth of the harbor, saying
plainly by her actions that she wished to
make port as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“It must be the <i>Olive Ann</i>,” declared Boardman
Blake; “and, Walter, I think you had
better go down to Spring’s wharf, and see
if everything is ready for the coaster there.”</p>

<p>Walter went to the wharf. Jabez Wherren,
a fisherman, stood leaning against an oaken
pier, watching the fluttering efforts of the
coaster to reach a sheltered resting&ndash;place.</p>

<p>“I expect that is a schooner uncle is expecting,
and she will come here, Mr. Wherren.
Will you look after her, please? I must go
back to the store.”</p>

<p>Receiving from the gray&ndash;headed old man a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
promise that he would give the <i>Olive Ann</i> a
reception befitting a dame of her commercial
position, Walter hurried away. He returned
to the store, and then left again in an hour for
the wharf, above which now shot up two tapering
masts, signaling the arrival of the coaster.
He was passing the schoolhouse at The
Harbor, when a little girl playing on the
rough step of stone before the door, looked up
and said, “I know you.”</p>

<p>It was Woodbury Elliott’s young companion,
the day he had visited Baggs’ shanty, and found
Walter there.</p>

<p>“Oh, that you?” said Walter stopping. “Do
you go to school here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Who is your teacher?”</p>

<p>“Sister.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you have any school to&ndash;day?”</p>

<p>“School is just out, but my sister hasn’t
gone.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if she is the one that Woodbury
said gave him his supper and hot coffee,”
thought Walter. “She knew how to cure a
man in trouble.”</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” said a pleasant voice in
the entry. Walter looked up, and there before
him, advancing also toward him with a hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
outstretched in welcome, was May Elliott.
The old schoolhouse in the fishing village
seemed to disappear at once, as by the touch of
a magician’s wand. In its place, was the
academy. Again, it was “composition day,”
and in May Elliott’s hand was a schoolgirl’s
composition, from which she was reading these
words: “The life that does not take into account
the need of those about us, that does not take
into account another life, that does not take
God into account, is making a serious mistake.”</p>

<p>All this came to Walter, and he stood in a
daze.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know me, Plympton? May
Elliott?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he said, quickly recovering from
his surprise. “But I was not looking for you,
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It gave you a surprise? Won’t you come
in?”</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, Miss Elliott. Why,
I didn’t know you were here!”</p>

<p>He followed her into the low&ndash;storied schoolroom,
and sat down in a chair that she placed
for him near the door.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am here. My home is here at The
Harbor, and you can see the house through
this window; that white house beyond the fishflakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in the field. There are some apple&ndash;trees
back of it, which you can see.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you were here,” said Walter
again, looking off from the house, and rapidly
taking the picture of the young teacher. She
was hardly of medium height, and was simply
clad, in a black alpaca dress, wearing at her
throat a crimson ribbon pinned with a small
cross of gold. Her brown hair was very soft
and fine, and of a luxuriant growth. Her
features were a little irregular, but her complexion
was fair, and then a certain brightness
and directness of look gave her blue eyes a
magnetic power.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she laughingly said, “I suppose you
would call me the village ‘schoolmarm,’ at
least, this fall. When I was a little girl, I remember&mdash;sitting
on one of those benches in
front,&mdash;I had an ambition to be some day the
teacher of the school. But, Plympton, I have
been wanting to see you, and thank you for
your kindness to my brother, Woodbury. He
has&mdash;has&mdash;a weakness, as you know; and what
you did that afternoon, checked him when he
was sorely tempted.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad if I did any good. And&mdash;and&mdash;I
have thought I would like to thank
<i>you</i>, sometime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“Do you remember your composition?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I believe I wrote a number of them.
Which one was it?”</p>

<p>“That one called, ‘What are we living for?’
That influenced me a good deal,” said Walter,
rising as if to go.</p>

<p>“Did it? I never knew that it helped anybody,
except, perhaps, it set me to thinking
more fully afterwards on the subject. Are you
going?”</p>

<p>“I think I must. But I want to thank you
for what you said; and if I can help Woodbury,
I will.”</p>

<p>In response, there was a bright look of sincere
pleasure shining out of May Elliott’s face.
Through the day, a pair of blue eyes followed
Walter in his thoughts, as if intent to overtake
him and ask him some question.</p>

<p>“Miss Elliott keeps your school,” he said to
Jabez Wherren on the wharf at a little later
hour.</p>

<p>“May, you mean? Wall, yes, and she’s
a smart leetle critter, not more’n sixteen
or seventeen; but she makes them young ones
toe the mark, I tell ye. We all think a good
deal of May; brought up here amongst us, you
know. There’s Woodbury, her brother; a smart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
feller as ever lived, if he would never tech
liquor. He might be a captain of his own
craft, jest as easy, jest as easy&mdash;as&mdash;as&mdash;mud.”
After this expressive and telling simile, Jabez
recovered the breath he had lost in that effort,
and continued: “It’s a bright family, the
Elliotts is. That little Amy, she’ll beat the
whole school a&ndash;spellin’&mdash;that is, all of her age.
Woodbury’s father and mother are well&ndash;to&ndash;do,
forehanded folks. He’s a skipper, and
is on this very schooner. What’s that?”</p>

<p>Jabez was now directing his attention to the
gangway of the <i>Olive Ann</i>, which had been
securely moored to the little wharf. A colored
boy in a shabby brown suit was disembarking,
carrying a very small bundle in his hand.
Springing out upon the wharf, he looked in
various directions, as if a stranger, and he was
calculating which way he had better go. A
choice between two routes offered itself, and he
chanced to take that which would lead him to
Boardman Blake’s store.</p>

<p>“Who’s that passenger?” asked Jabez of
Captain Elliott, a muscular, heavy man of fifty.</p>

<p>“I can’t say. He shipped at New York, and
worked for his passage. He wanted to be off
soon as I could spare him, and I said he might
go now, or stay longer. He’d rather be off now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
I’m afeared he won’t pick up any work very
soon, but he will probably push on till he finds
some sort of a chance.”</p>

<p>Walter went home thinking of this unknown
youth, a stranger, homeless, tramping off anywhere.
Aunt Lydia met him in the kitchen.
A very broad grin was on her face, as if the
old lady had found a prize that made her very
happy.</p>

<p>“Come into the addition,” said she, beckoning
mysteriously. “Step softly, you know. I’ve
got suthin’ to show you.”</p>

<p>The “addition” was built on to the rear of
the house, and contained two rooms, the lower
being a kind of store&ndash;room.</p>

<p>“There!” said Aunt Lydia, pointing at the
corner.</p>

<p>Curled up under an old quilt, a smile brightening
a face happy in a trip to some beautiful
dream&ndash;land, was the “passenger,” as Jabez had
entitled him, who had just arrived per coaster
<i>Olive Ann</i>.</p>

<p>“Ho, Aunt Lyddy! You got Young Africa
there?” whispered Walter.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I didn’t have the heart to turn
him away. You see he came to the door, and
sort of mournful, looked up and asked for a
leetle suthin’ to eat, and said he would work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
first, and I didn’t have the heart to refuse him.
Then I sez, ‘Where you goin’?’ ‘Dunno,’ he
sez; and I thought it wasn’t jest Christian to let
him go a&ndash;wanderin’ off into the world when
the night was a&ndash;comin’, and I sez, pointin’ to
your Uncle Boardman in the barnyard, ‘you
might ax that man, and if he’s a&ndash;willin’, and can
give you suthin’ to do, you can stay here till
mornin’.’ And it would have done your soul
good to have seen how grateful that child was
when Boardman sez&mdash;and I knew he would&mdash;‘I’ll
leave it to Lyddy.’”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?” asked Walter, when
they were in the kitchen once more, leaving
that “child” to his happy rest under Aunt
Lyddy’s homemade bedquilt; which, like its
owner, was a little rough on the outside, but
exceedingly warm within.</p>

<p>“Pedro White, he told me. And jest think,
I told it to your Uncle Boardman, and he laffed
and said ‘Pedro’ was Spanish, and he ought to
be called ‘Don Pedro.’ You know your uncle
has read a ’mazin’ sight.”</p>

<p>Aunt Lydia had a very large respect for
her husband’s “book&ndash;larnin’,” as she called it.
It must be acknowledged though, that before
the pressure of each day’s necessities, Uncle
Boardman, with his “book&ndash;larnin’,” would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
often retreat; while Aunt Lydia, gifted only
with her sharp, practical sense, would advance
triumphantly. This fact does not prove that
book knowledge is of little worth. It is extremely
valuable. It should go hand in hand
with excellent judgment to make it of the
greatest value to its possessor. “That child”
slept profoundly under Aunt Lydia’s bedquilt,
which rivaled the rain&ndash;bow in its many colors
and the sunshine in its warmth.</p>

<p class="pch">THE HALL SERVICE.</p>

<p>Did I not say there was only one store
at The Harbor? I beg Miss P.
Green’s pardon. She did not claim
in so many words to “keep store,” and yet
if anybody had actually denied her right
to the use of that grand word, “store,” there
would have been a tempest at The Harbor.
She merely said that she “kept a few little articles”;
and yet the black king of the Bigboos in
the depths of Africa, would not think more of a
red handkerchief and a hand looking&ndash;glass, than
Miss P. Green did of her three shelves of
“goods,” and one small show&ndash;case of pins,
needles, gooseberries, lemon drops, and stationary,
in her front room. Gooseberries and lemon
drops, I say, for Miss P. Green kept only these,
believing that you could sell more if you kept
one article, and “got your name up” on the
merits of that one article. In this case there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
were two articles; but never were there such
gooseberries before, nor have there been such
lemon drops since. The gooseberries would

and hard, and round enough&mdash;at a game of baseball;
and as for the lemon drops, into what rapture
those sugared acids, or that acidulated sugar
rather, would throw any schoolboy or girl, at
“recess&ndash;time.” Then Miss P. Green kept the
post&ndash;office! There is no adjective I can now
recall, of sufficient magnitude and magnificence
to represent the importance which Miss P.
Green attached to this position. Her ideas were
not unduly exalted until she had seen the
Boston post&ndash;office, and enjoyed an interview
with the Boston post&ndash;master. She then felt
that her position was unusual. She never
looked upon her humble wooden walls as she
came down the street, but that they changed
to a granite façade, with lofty doors and pillars;
and when she entered her abode she walked at
once upon a marble pavement. What importance
she felt when she handled the stamp,
whose magic impress she must first make, before
any letter could start on its travels from The
Harbor. The Great Charlemagne pounding
with his golden seal, did not feel half as grand.
And those clumsy leathern pouches that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
called mai&ndash;lbags, and which only Miss P. Green
could open&mdash;how she venerated them! True
Billings, the driver of the mail&ndash;wagon, handled
them roughly, and pitched them upon the doorstep
without ceremony, bawling out, “Here
you have ’em!” By the post&ndash;mistress, they
were approached with a certain respect and awe,
whose weight would crush the official opening
the great treasury&ndash;vaults of the nation, did he
regard these with corresponding feelings of importance.
It was stoutly secured to the door
frame outside with good shingle nails, that
sign indicating Miss P. Green’s official place in
The Harbor world: “Post&ndash;office.” On the door
leading from the entry into the front room was
the name “P. Green.” This indicated her place
in the great world of trade. If it had been
attached to the outer door, it would have saved
me an ugly omission, for I should at once have
given her honorable mention in the business
list of The Harbor. The sign occupied an
outer position once, but boys do not always
have that respect for authority which is becoming,
and had changed the name one night to
“Pea Green.” It was indignantly withdrawn
the next day. It was just as well removed,
I dare say, for if she had continued to daily see
those two signs, “Post&ndash;office,” and “P. Green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>,”
as she approached the building, the sense of her
official and commercial importance would finally
have been too much for her. As it was, she
passed from the contemplation of one sign to
the other, and there was a gradual letting
down from that sense of exaltation which she
had on seeing the front door.</p>

<p>But all of Miss P. Green’s merits have not
been mentioned. She was a very little body,
and that may seem a detraction from her excellencies,
and yet it was only another praiseworthy
feature; for never in such small compass
was packed so much knowledge. No
“Saratoga” trunk ever went to “Springs,”
so loaded, crowded, jammed. She was the
village register; could tell the births and deaths
and marriages for the year, giving each date.
Not so surprising a fact, considering that the
village was small; but when you add to this a
complete knowledge of every household, how
many were in each family, their names, occupations,
what they had for breakfast, dinner
and supper, what time they went to bed, and
what time they left their beds, the register kept
by P. Green, grew into a village directory
and a village history. But this tree of knowledge
did not stop its growth here. It had
other branches. She knew all of the mysteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of dressmaking and millinery; had a large
acquaintance with housekeeping and nursing;
kept posted in politics, and considered it her
duty to defend the “administration,” though
unfairly denied the right of suffrage.</p>

<p>One of the latest achievements of this encyclopedia,
was to obtain complete and reliable information
about the life saving station. This
she had done by carefully cultivating the acquaintance
of Keeper Barney. She was now
at work on these two subjects, the Baggs
family and all its branches; also the Plympton
family; and this had the second place, as
Walter’s arrival was the more recent. Such a
wonder! So very much in so very little! It
was a terrible satire on her size, that misnomer
Pea Green, for in one sense it was exceedingly
unjust. Not even the mammoth peas that grow
in the land of the giants, could furnish so much
comfort and delight to a dining circle of twelve,
as this feminine wonder by the sea. And to all
hungry gossipers, she did what no restaurant
will do; she fed without cost all who came.</p>

<p>It was the most natural thing in the world,
then, that Aunt Lydia should say one day to
Walter, “I know how I can find out. I can
ask Miss Green.”</p>

<p>She accordingly went to the post&ndash;office and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
asked Miss Green as follows: “My nephew,
Walter Plympton, wants to know about the
Hall. Who has the say about it; that is, who
lets people use it?”</p>

<p>Miss Green was delighted. She would not
only find out what this use of the Hall
might mean, but oh, what an opportunity to
learn about the Plympton family! Sitting on
a tall stool, which was an innocent contrivance
to eke out her scanty height, she persuasively
bent her gray curls over the show&ndash;case. Her
once bright eyes had softened down to a faded
blue; and time had laid on her forehead and
cheeks its stamp whose mark was as certain as
that of the begrimed die with which she
fiercely struck the daily mail. She had a
pleasant voice, an affable manner, a temperament
sunny and hopeful; and people liked
to talk with the post&ndash;mistress. The initiated
also knew that in a certain back sitting&ndash;room
there was a brown teapot always kept on the
stove, adding to the charms of that snug retreat
to which any tea&ndash;toper might be favored with
an invitation.</p>

<p>“The Hall! Indeed! Going to be a singing&ndash;school?&mdash;a&mdash;a?”
inquired the post&ndash;mistress.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Now it’s strange Walter should
have such a notion, you may think, but he’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
one of that kind whose head is allers full of
suthin’. He came to me yesterday, and sez
to me, ‘Aunt Lyddy!’ Sez I, ‘What?’ He
didn’t say any more, for suthin’ called him to
the door, and I was a&ndash;ironin’ and went on where
I was. It was warm, you know. Don’t you
think it was? I did feel it over the ironin’.”</p>

<p>Aunt Lydia had a tantalizing way sometimes
of telling a story. She would enter very fully
into details, amplifying little items and leaving
the main subject untouched.</p>

<p>“But the point&mdash;the point&mdash;Lyddy,” gently
observed the post&ndash;mistress.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. By and by he came back agin;
and what do you s’pose he said he was a
thinkin’ about?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“I was then in the kitchen. No, I was
standin’ afore the clock&mdash;yes&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But that’s no matter. What did he say,
Lyddy? The point, dear?”</p>

<p>“Well, he axed who had the say about the
Hall. I told him I didn’t know; and how
could I be ’spected to know, Phebe?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Then you want to know
who can let him or anybody else have the
Hall? It’s Cap’n Elliott, you know. He’s
the trustee, as I call it. Why, the Hall was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
given by old Nathan Grant for the good of The
Harbor, he said, and he made Cap’n Elliott
trustee. So Walter must ask him.”</p>

<p>“I see, I see.”</p>

<p>“Now, Lyddy! Is Walter’s father’s name
Adoniram?”</p>

<p>Aunt Lydia perceived at once that the post&ndash;mistress
now wished to take her turn in obtaining
information, and she knew it would be a
long turn. She moved towards the door, remarking,
“Oh, no, it’s Ezra. Thank you, Miss
Green; I guess I must be a&ndash;goin’.”</p>

<p>“But do take a cup of tea before you go,”
pleaded Miss Green, fastening on Aunt Lydia
a beseeching look. At the same time, the
post&ndash;mistress sidled down from her tall, four&ndash;legged
throne, and began to move towards the
little brown teapot. Aunt Lydia said something
to the effect that yesterday it was warm,
but it was a “chilly east wind to&ndash;day”; and she
followed the post&ndash;mistress in the direction of
the warmer atmosphere of the teapot. Having
obtained all the knowledge she wished in the
Plympton line, Miss P. Green poured out
another cup of tea, and remarked suddenly,
“And isn’t Baggs queer?”</p>

<p>“Queer! That don’t begin to describe him,
Phebe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“He was here the other day. Came, you
know, on special business about his mail, and
said he had been a&ndash;trying to get down here I
don’t know how long. He wanted an arrangement
so that letters could come to him, in a box.
Now that’s very nice, you know, when you
have a class of customers wanting it. They
have boxes in the Boston post&ndash;office you know,
and I thought I might take it into consideration.
He said he was going to send out circulars
about something, and answers would
come for ‘Rambler, Box one,’ if I would put
one in for him. Well, if you believe it, before
I had a chance to give him an answer, he went
to that window in the office that looks toward
the harbor&mdash;the offing, I mean.” Miss Green
was, or aimed to be, very correct, having once
taught school. “What a start he gave! and
he turned round, pale as&mdash;as&mdash;that paint on
the office&ndash;door.” It was not very white. “I
didn’t seem to notice it, but only said in an off&ndash;hand
way, ‘Do you see anything, Mr. Baggs?’
I thought it might be a vessel sailing in. But
he didn’t take any notice. Then I said again&mdash;mild,
sort of&mdash;‘The sea quiet, Mr. Baggs?
Anything out of the way? Can you see the
Chair? You know if we can’t see the
Chair on account of fog, it is a bad sign any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
way; and every day, people look off there.’
You ought to have seen that man start again
and almost give a real jump. ‘Chair?’ he said.
‘What have I got to do with that Chair?
Chair?’ And if he didn’t rush out of the
store! I couldn’t see anything that was the
matter with the Chair. And there that man
who had been so anxious to see me, went off
and left everything unsettled. Now wasn’t
it queer, Lyddy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that Baggs is a very, very unprofitable
subject of talk for me, and I have made
up my mind to shet my mouth on him&mdash;for the
present.”</p>

<p>Aunt Lydia’s mouth here shut with all the
decision of a portcullis.</p>

<p>Miss Green, though, was not prepared to
close her portals of speech, and question after
question did she ask about the Plymptons, back
to the first that came from England.</p>

<p>If she had only known there was a Don
Pedro in the world! She had a way of pursing
up her mouth after a question, and then of fastening
on one a very direct look, and all this
was as irresistible as a corkscrew in the presence
of a stopper. Aunt Lydia left the post&ndash;mistress
and returned home.</p>

<p>But what was Walter’s object that led to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
interview? What did he want the Hall
for? St. John’s, the parish church, was a mile
and a half away. On days when the wind was
right, its bell could be heard faintly, musically
calling all souls to prayer. Not often though
did these sweet notes travel as far as The Harbor,
and the consequence was, that very few
souls traveled up to church. In fair weather,
Miss Green and Mrs. Jabez Wherren might
walk there, or they would report at Uncle
Boardman’s in season to take passage in his
big covered wagon that, rain or shine, was
sure to be heard rattling along to St. John’s
every Sunday. The remainder of the population
virtually ignored St. John’s, and St. John’s
ignored them. Its clergyman came down to
say a few words of Christian farewell over
the bodies that might rest behind the stunted
firs in the little cemetery swept by the
sea&ndash;winds, or to join for a life&ndash;long clasp, the
two hands willing thus to fall into one another.
Otherwise St. John’s had very little to do with
The Harbor, and The Harbor responded in the
same fashion.</p>

<p>“Why,” thought Walter, walking down
through The Harbor one Sunday, “it doesn’t
look much like Sunday down here. Uncle
Boardman doesn’t live in one of these houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>The Harbor village had anything but that
Sunday look which marked Uncle Boardman’s
premises. Some of the fishermen were out in
their yards overhauling and mending their
trawls. One or two were doing a little
autumn work in their rough gardens. In an
open lot behind the gray, lichen&ndash;patched ledges,
several young fishermen, in red shirts, were
playing ball. There was a row of fishing&ndash;smacks
at an ancient wharf, and their owners
were improving Sunday’s convenient leisure
for the accomplishment of odd little jobs. Sunday
at The Harbor was respected by the inhabitants
after their peculiar fashion. Every
fishing&ndash;boat came back to its quiet moorings
before Sunday, as promptly as if a police force
had ordered it there. Then came a day at
home, not of entire abstinence from work, but
of less work. To do less, not to quit work altogether,
was the Sunday fashion of The Harbor.
A man would have lost caste, and been
ranked as a heathen, if he had taken his boat
out to sea, every Sunday. He might stay at
home, and be busy all day with little “jobs,”
and not hurt his reputation for religion. One
fisherman abstained entirely from work, Jabez
Wherren. He did not go to church, declaring
that “somebody must stay at home and look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
arter it; at which place all religion began.” He
did not work though. He would lounge about
all day, dressed in his very best suit, and decked
out with some very bright necktie, and flourishing
a flaming red or yellow silk handkerchief, so
that he looked like a man&ndash;of&ndash;war decorated
with flags. Because he did not go to church,
Jabez knew that his wife ranked him as a
very deficient being; but on the other hand,
because he did not work, he was well aware
that in the eyes of his fellow&ndash;fishermen,
he was regarded as a person of superior virtues.
In his walk that Sunday, Walter at last
was opposite the Hall, an antiquated, one&ndash;storied
building that needed the services of both
painter and carpenter. It was prefaced, though,
by a porch, with two very imposing Doric pillars.
This porch compensated for all deficiencies;
and the villagers walking between those
pillars felt grand as a Roman army, marching
under the triumphal arch of Titus, in the “Eternal
City.” Walter halted before the Hall and
there held this soliloquy. “I have got an idea.
Mother wanted me to do some special religious
work; and, I’m afraid&mdash;I know I haven’t. She
wanted me to get people to go to church if
they didn’t go, and now here is a chance.
There’s the new rector at St. John’s. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
young, and full of life, and I wonder if he
couldn’t come down here and hold services,
once every now and then at any rate. It
would be just the thing, I declare.” Walter’s
hazel eyes snapped with interest, and a smile
swept over his round, full face.</p>

<p>“What’s Boardman Blake’s nephew up to,
a lookin’ at the Hall?” wondered Jabez
Wherren. Walter did not relieve him of his
wonder, but soon turned about and went home.</p>

<p>“The first thing,” he said, “is to find out
who has the letting of the Hall.”</p>

<p>Aunt Lydia ascertained this fact for him, and
informed him that the trustee was May Elliott’s
grandfather.</p>

<p>“Then I must go and see the schoolmarm,”
remarked Walter, “and get her to help me.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re going to really try?” said Aunt
Lydia.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Walter positively.</p>

<p>“Seems to me they might go up to St.
John’s.”</p>

<p>“But they won’t, and St. John’s must come
to them.”</p>

<p>“Now, Walter, I don’t want to throw a
speck of cold water on it, but do you expect to
succeed?”</p>

<p>“Well, Aunt, it won’t do any harm to try,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and I am going to expect to succeed, too. I
was reading about Admiral Farragut, what he
said, that any man who is prepared for defeat
would be half defeated before he commenced.
He said he hoped for success and would try to
have it, and trust God for the rest.”</p>

<p>“It looks to me jest like castin’ pearls afore
swine.”</p>

<p>Walter laughed, and said he would go to the
schoolhouse and find its mistress. May said
she would see her grandfather, and ask for the
Hall.</p>

<p>“But whom shall we get to play? Somebody
said there was a melodeon in the Hall,
and somebody else said&mdash;you&mdash;you played on
it.”</p>

<p>“And you want me to play? Well, I will
do what I can. I am interested, and where I
can help, I will. I will see if I can’t get two
or three singers.”</p>

<p>That day, May went to her grandfather’s.
He sat by the window of his little house that
looked out upon the river racing, at the base
of the rough, rocky banks, toward the wide,
restless sea. He was not a happy old man.
True he had been a successful seaman. He had
a sufficient amount of property to make him
comfortable. He had no vices to regret. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
had, though, known sorrow, losing wife and
children. He and his housekeeper were the
only ones in his home. He had been disappointed
in his grandson, Woodbury, whom he
desired to share his home with; and people
said that old Capt. Elliott wished to give
Woodbury the largest fraction of the money
and other valuables he was supposed to keep in
a certain bulky safe in his sitting&ndash;room. Woodbury,
though, in the short interval he had tried
to live at his grandfather’s, had been twice intoxicated,
and the last time angry words had
flamed between them like hot coals that they
were throwing. He left the house in wrath,
and in wrath Capt. Elliott shut the door after
him. The captain was not a religious man.
He was very honest, and having once been
cheated by a professor of religion who was
a very scanty possessor of it, wholly lacking
it indeed, Capt. Elliott ever afterwards declared
himself superior to the character that
the church required. He shut out God from
his soul, because a hypocrite shut him out from
his dues. He made his honesty his all, and
was a prayerless, peevish, fault&ndash;finding, selfish
old man. When May called, he was still looking
out of the window. The sea&ndash;wind lifted
and let fall his thin, white hair, but could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
lift from his stern, sharp&ndash;cut features, the
shadow of a cheerless, selfish life. He heard
his granddaughter’s voice, and turned to meet
her. When she had made her request, he
said, “For how long do you want the Hall?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. We are going to begin
at any rate. We want to see what interest
there will be.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I s’pose you can have it. That’s
what the Hall is for, to hold all kind of reason’ble
meetin’s.”</p>

<p>Here May made a bold movement, and her
blue eyes were full of courage as she asked,
“And, grandfather, won’t you come too?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense, child! I have more religion
now than you could pack into St. John’s. Why,
I’d be ashamed to do what some of them
folks do.”</p>

<p>May was a strategist. She knew it was useless
to argue with him. She also knew that he
liked to hear her play her melodeon in the sacred
parlor at home, kept in state there all the
week with the dried grasses on the mantel, and
the family register on the wall, and the big
family Bible on the mahogany table.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come to hear me play?”</p>

<p>“May, I’ll make this agreement. I’ll come
down and stay as long as you play and sing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
but I’m not a&ndash;goin’ to stay and have any min’ster
advise me in a long sermon, for I know as
much as he about it, and more too.”</p>

<p>“Well, grandfather, stay while the singing
lasts.”</p>

<p>There was another invitation extended.
This was given by Walter to Chauncy Aldrich.</p>

<p>“Ah, ah,” said Chauncy in his self&ndash;important
way, lifting his hat, and with great dignity
running his hand through his wall of hair,
“you want me to honor the place with the
presence of C. Aldrich? Yes, I’ll come. But
look here, none of your long, prosy sermons,
but something warm, and something short.
Ha, ha!”</p>

<p>One by one, all preparations were made for
the service. Miss Green promised to lend her
cracked voice to the “choir,” and two or three
young fishermen offered to roar in the bass.
Don Pedro, whom Uncle Boardman had kept
at his house to assist in some of the autumn
work on the farm, made himself very helpful
in sweeping out the Hall and arranging its
seats.</p>

<p>“What time do you expect the clergyman
will hold the service?” inquired Miss Green, as
Walter was about leaving the post&ndash;office one day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I think he will come in the evening, if
we want him,” replied Walter.</p>

<p>“There!” reflected this young master of ceremonies
as he left the house. “If that isn’t just
like me! I declare if I didn’t forget to ask the
clergyman! But of course he will come, and I
will take Uncle Boardman’s team and go up at
once, to ask him.”</p>

<p>Alas, the rector couldn’t come!</p>

<p>Walter drove back in despair.</p>

<p>“I’ll stop at the schoolhouse and see the
schoolmarm,” he said, “and ask what is to be
done, though I know she will laugh at me.”</p>

<p>The school had just been dismissed; and May
only lingered to set away her few books in her
desk.</p>

<p>“Ah, Miss Elliott,” said Walter confusedly.
“I&mdash;I&mdash;I’m afraid it doesn’t look hopeful&mdash;about&mdash;about
our Hall service?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>He laughed, and blushed, and said frankly, “I
went ahead and got everything ready but the
minister!”</p>

<p>“You hadn’t spoken to him!”</p>

<p>“No, and it was just like me, mother would
say. I got my cart and had it nicely packed,
or you did rather,” a compliment which made
the young teacher look quite rosy,&mdash;“I got my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
cart, but I hadn’t thought about my horse!
When I spoke just now to Dr. Ellton, he said
his hands were full, and he couldn’t possibly
come. Just like me! I needed it perhaps, for
I was saying, ‘What a grand thing I am helping
along!’ And here is my cart all packed
and ready to start, and where is my horse?”</p>

<p>The young teacher was amused and pleased
with Walter’s frankness.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, Plympton, we won’t give up. I
have done things that way myself. Somebody
can take the service, I know. Isn’t there any
one else at St. John’s?”</p>

<p>“There is a young fellow who, I believe,
comes on Sundays to help the doctor; Raynham,
I think, is his name.”</p>

<p>“You ask him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Raynham was asked. Would he come?
His black eyes lighted up as he gave his
answer: “I should be delighted. I only help
at the morning service, and I can come down
as well as not in the evening. The doctor
would like to have me, I know.”</p>

<p>“It does me good,” thought Walter, “just
the way he accepts my invitation. Wonder if
ministers&mdash;and other folks&mdash;know how much
good it does when they promise a thing that
fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>!”</p>

<p>Mr. Raynham engaged to take tea at Aunt
Lydia’s, Sunday afternoon, and for this young
prophet, she heaped her table with biscuit, and
cake, and doughnuts, till it looked liked a fort
with its outworks.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said to Mr. Raynham, when he
was leaving for the Hall, “you mustn’t go a&ndash;flyin’
over our heads to&ndash;night when you speak.”</p>

<p>He gave his shoulders a nervous twitch,
smiled, and said, “It’s only a talk, I have, when
we have finished evening prayer.”</p>

<p>“If you let it come from the heart,” said
Aunt Lydia encouragingly, “your arrer will
be sent out from a strong bow. You see
’twon’t do allers to have jest what will do for
big&ndash;folks. You jest talk out of your heart, and
think of us as leetle folks, and your arrers will
hit the mark, sure.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” thought the young assistant,
“and may God give me my message.”</p>

<p>He felt his need all the more, for May Elliott
came to him and said, “If you see an old man
going out when we have finished the singing,
don’t you think anything of it. I could only
get him here on the condition that he might be
excused after the music.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” reflected Mr. Raynham. “I will
see that the music lasts some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>What a service that was! The choir sang
with remarkable heartiness, even if it did
not execute with remarkable skill. True, Miss
Green’s voice was a little unsteady on the high
notes, and fluttered about like a man on a high
ladder, who growing dizzy, and threatening to
fall, catches distractedly at the rounds.</p>

<p>The young fishermen, too, thundered away
on the “Ah&ndash;men” as if to atone for previous deficiencies,
and roared for half a minute in a
bass monotone that suggested the ocean. Then
there was Don Pedro. When he was clearing
up the hall, May Elliott was rehearsing on the
melodeon, and she heard his voice several times
accompanying the tunes. She impressed him
into the musical service at once, and never
did any royal tenor or bass from Italy, feel
his importance more sensibly. As Don Pedro
was very lacking in the department of “best
clothes,” Aunt Lydia promised to “rig” him
out in some of Uncle Boardman’s superfluous
garments. Don Pedro was somewhat tall and
slender, and Uncle Boardman was short and
thick, and the “rigging” was not a close fit.
The clothes hung about Don Pedro like the
sails of a ship about the slender poles of a fishing&ndash;smack.
Genius, though, is superior to all
inconveniences, and above Uncle Boardman’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
immense coat, Don Pedro’s head struggled
manfully. He did not have a sharp sense of
the ludicrous, and only remarked, “I guess as
how dese clo’es was made for anudder man,
shuah.”</p>

<p>And the audience&mdash;it filled all the rough
seats in the hall. Did Mr. Raynham see that
face of an old man, sad and hopeless, near the
door? No, he only knew some indefinite,
nameless “old man” was there, itching to go
out when the musical part of the service had
been completed.</p>

<p>“We will vary the usual order of such services
as these, to&ndash;night, and after I have spoken
five minutes, we will have more music; a
hymn,” said Mr. Raynham.</p>

<p>“Ah,” thought Capt. Elliott, squirming in his
seat and ready to retreat, “I guess I shall
have to hold on, for I promised my grand&ndash;darter.”</p>

<p>How Mr. Raynham did talk “out of his
heart,” to some imaginary old sinner trying to
avoid his duty, and get away from God’s house!</p>

<p>What would that soul do when God met him
in judgment, and he could not escape, possibly?
Capt. Elliott wriggled very uneasily; but there
was his promise to May!</p>

<p>“We will now have some music,” said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Raynham. Again rose the choir, Don Pedro
struggling above his mammoth outfit; Miss
Green springing up with voice ready to mount
to the ladder’s top, and there tumble; the
young fishermen on hand for an oceanic roar&mdash;at
the close.</p>

<p>“I’ll go now,” thought the captain, but the
young prophet called out, “I will say a few
words, and then we will have more music,
another hymn.”</p>

<p>Capt. Elliott felt that he was a pinioned bird.
Stay he must, and all the while the young
man on the platform shot his arrows.</p>

<p>“He’s a talkin’ out of his heart to some poor
prodigal,” thought Aunt Lydia. “God help
him!”</p>

<p>Then that beautiful appeal in the hymnal
was sung, that Advent appeal;</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“O Jesus, thou art standing<br />
Outside the fast&ndash;closed door,</p>
<p class="pph4">In lowly patience waiting<br />
To pass the threshold o’er:</p>
<p class="pph4">We bear the name of Christians,<br />
His name and sign we bear:</p>
<p class="pph4">O shame, thrice shame upon us,<br />
To keep him standing there.”</p>

<p class="p1">“O dear!” groaned the captain. “That’s
me! I can’t stand this. Guess I’ll go now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>The young fishermen were now roaring “Ah&ndash;men!”
and if they had been allowed to imitate
the ocean long as they pleased, Capt. Elliott
might have escaped. Mr. Raynham saw an
old man rising, and guessing the object of the
movement, waved his hand imperatively to
the male singers. The ocean did not finish its
roar very gracefully, but above the confused
tumbling of the surf, Mr. Raynham’s voice
rose triumphantly. “We will have music
again, in a moment. A few words more.”
Capt. Elliott remembered his promise to May,
and reluctantly sat down.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Catch me makin’ sich a promise
next time!” inwardly moaned the captain.</p>

<p>In those “few words more,” Mr. Raynham
made a pathetic appeal to his audience, and
especially to those who were old, and yet
trying to live without the love of their Father
in heaven.</p>

<p>“That would go to the heart of a stone
krockerdile,” declared Aunt Lydia.</p>

<p>No, it went to the heart of a human being;
and stony though it may have seemed to an outsider,
it was tender yet, for homeward went that
night an old man, creeping slowly and alone,
sore and wounded in his soul, conscience&ndash;sick.</p>

<p>And Chauncy Aldrich, how did he feel?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“That was a good sermon, Aldrich,” said
Walter after the service.</p>

<p>Chauncy gave a laugh, ringing, and hard, and
brassy: “Ah&mdash;ah! That young feller did get
warmed up, warmed up, Plympton; but you
can’t expect a business man like me, always
watching the market and pushing trade, to be
thinking about these things. By and by,
Plympton!” Ah, that by&ndash;and&ndash;by flag! Many
noble ships have sailed fatally under.</p>

<p>The people were interested in the service.</p>

<p>“Come again,” said Aunt Lydia to Mr.
Raynham; “come again. We all want you.
Come, if you haven’t anything big for wise folks,
and only suthin’ simple for fools; for you will
have lots of ’em here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Raynham said he would come another
Sunday; perhaps the very next.</p>

<p>The Sunday that the Hall had been occupied,
chanced to be Michaelmas beautiful festival,
ripe like the landscape with color and
fruitage. All nature&mdash;its maples, its oaks, its
fields, its orchards&mdash;was shining with the glow
of St. Michael’s triumph over the dragon. And
in the rough little fishing village by the sea, it
seemed as if the brave, mighty archangel had
given the old dragon another thrust, and Right
had sorely wounded the Wrong.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE BOAT&ndash;RACE.</p>

<p>No less a wonder than a boat&ndash;race was announced
on an October day, and no less
a person than Chauncy Aldrich planned
the wonder.</p>

<p>“We need to wake ’em up, wake ’em up,”
he said to Walter, and he ran his hand through
his bristling rampart of hair. “Trade is dull,
and needs stimulating. People that want to do
business must make business. I have passed
a subscription paper round, and the business
men of the community have handed out
quite liberally. Your uncle, I am sorry to say,
did not seem to have a commendable local
pride, I should say, and refused to help us.
However, we propose to have the race, and give
a purse of twenty&ndash;five dollars to the successful
boat in a six&ndash;oared race. Entries can be made
by any parties living inside of ten miles from
here. Yes, we are going to wake up some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
trade, and so we have thought it best to have a
boat&ndash;race.” A purse of twenty&ndash;five dollars!
That sounded large as&mdash;the Atlantic Ocean.
It consisted, however, of Baggs’ very liberal
“promise” of twenty dollars, or double even
(and it is very easy to multiply a “promise”
any number of times), an actual subscription of
four dollars from Timothy Pullins&mdash;Uncle
Boardman’s business&ndash;rival at The Harbor&mdash;and
then Miss Green was so tickled to be accounted
one of the business community, and to
receive an invitation to subscribe, that she had
actually handed over the magnificent sum of
one silver dollar.</p>

<p>The neighborhood was very much excited
over the event. Walter had been selected as
one of the crew in Chauncy’s boat, and with
his usual enthusiasm, he practiced rowing at
all leisure moments. Aunt Lydia found him
“going through the motions,” as he declared
it, behind the counter of the store, even.</p>

<p>“What ye doin’, Walter?”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, Aunt! Only going through the
motions, practicing the stroke Chauncy gave
us. He says it is the best in the country.
There, you shove forward so&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! I want somebody to shove the
saw for me in the shed. My fire is dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
low. I’ll tend the store while you are
gone.”</p>

<p>Walter transferred this trial stroke to the
saw&ndash;horse at once.</p>

<p>He planned the next morning, to rise half an
hour earlier than usual, and row awhile on the
river. “Am I late?” he said, opening his eyes
early, and from his bed looking out of a window
toward the sea. The sun was just coming
up, and had suffused with a rich crimson the
placid waters.</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” Walter said, and hurriedly
dressed himself. He was about leaving the
room, when he said, “There’s my Bible! I
almost forgot that. The fact is you have to be
particular about reading, or you will miss a
morning pretty readily.”</p>

<p>It is very easy to make gaps in our devotions,
and a gap made to&ndash;day may mean a gap
to&ndash;morrow, and when two or three days go by
and no Bible has been read, it is very easy to
widen the break into an interval of a week.
There is nothing so weakening as an intermission
now and then. On the other hand,
there is nothing that so pays us a handsome
profit, as a little care to keep up a good habit.
The human will is a curious piece of machinery,
and the simple fact that we are in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
habit of doing certain things, of going to
church, of reading our Bible, saying our
prayers, this year, is one of the strongest reasons
why we shall be likely to do this next
year, and will have vast influence in giving a
set and direction to our character. Walter
had begun to realize this, and he said to himself,
“If I am going to read my Bible, I must
be particular to read it every morning.” He
sat down in a yellow chair by the window
fronting the sea, and opened his Bible. This
was one of the verses he read that morning;
“Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his
way? By taking heed thereto according to Thy
word. With my whole heart, have I sought
Thee: O let me not wander from Thy commandments.”</p>

<p>Somehow, those words were pressed into
his memory; printed vividly there like those
shining colors off in the sea. When he had
finished his reading, he stepped softly downstairs,
passed out into the yard, and then made
his way to his boat on the shore of the river.
The morning though bright and clear, was
chilly, and the rowing of the new stroke imparted
by Chauncy was “good as the stove in
Aunt Lyddy’s kitchen to make one feel warm,”
Walter thought. He finished his practice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
was about stepping from the boat upon the
smooth little pebbles strewn along the
“landin’,” as the fishermen called it, when a
sharp voice startled him. “Hul&ndash;<i>lo</i>!”</p>

<p>Turning, Walter saw Chauncy Aldrich.</p>

<p>“That you, Aldrich?”</p>

<p>“Nobody else, Plympton. Out trying my
new stroke?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s first rate to warm a fellow up.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll find it good to make a boat go.
It’s as good a stroke as you will find in the
market.”</p>

<p>Here Chauncy lifted his hat, and thrusting
his hand through his hair and piling it up
anew, gave a defiant look, as if saying to all the
world, “I’ll dare you to bring on another stroke
as good as this.” Then he resumed his
conversation.</p>

<p>“See here, Plympton. I just wanted to see
you, and I came out here on purpose, thinking
I might find you, after what you said one day
that you thought you should take an early
hour for practice. A business man, you know,
must be on hand early to catch custom, and I
wanted to see you about something special.
Just you and me, and no more!”</p>

<p>Chauncy said this with an air of secrecy, of
patronage also; as if he had reserved for Walter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and Walter only, some unknown, distinguished
honor. He drew close to Walter,
and dropping his voice said, “I expect that our
opponents next Tuesday, the day for the race,
will be the Scarlet Grays from Campton.”</p>

<p>“Scarlet Grays?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they wear scarlet caps and gray pants,
and then scarlet slippers again, and look quite
nobby. But that’s according to fancy. You
and I mean business, and that’s what we are
after, and can get along in our every day wear.
That’s what I think.”</p>

<p>Here he gave a wise little chuckle, and shook
his head very decidedly and knowingly, so that
he reminded Walter of those days when the
academy students called him, “Solomon.”</p>

<p>“But here’s to the point. A&ndash;hem!”</p>

<p>Chauncy dropped his voice still lower, and
tapping the palm of his left hand with the
forefinger of his right, sharply eyed a rock in
the river as if he would be willing to take this
rock into the secret, but for no consideration
could he admit a second rock.</p>

<p>“You see, Plympton&mdash;ahem!”</p>

<p>Then he shrugged his shoulders. It was
evident he wished to say something, and yet
had a misgiving with regard to the fitness of
the message, or Walter’s fitness to hear it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, out with it, Aldrich!” said Walter,
his open, honest face contrasting strongly with
the sly look of reserve on his companion’s features.
“Out with it! That’s business, as you
say.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, Plympton! You’ve got me there,
sure. Well, as I was going to say, Lang Tripp,
the captain of the Scarlet Grays, came to me
the other day and said he, ‘Look here, Aldrich!
This is between you and me.’ ‘Of course,’ said
I. ‘Are you anxious to win in that boat&ndash;race?’
‘Well,’ said I, ‘we mean business, of course;
but if we are whipped, we must submit. When
a man goes into the market to buy, he must do
the best he can, and let it go at that. That’s
the way of it, of course,’ said I. ‘When a man
goes into the market,’ he said&mdash;you said&mdash;no&mdash;he
said”&mdash;</p>

<p>The business man tumbled over half a dozen
“saids” and began again. “I mean that he
referred to what I said about going into the
market, and then went on, ‘That helps me to
come to the point, which is&mdash;is&mdash;a little understanding&mdash;trade,
some folks might call it,
though I don’t.’ Then he went on, and this is
what it amounted to. They have gone&mdash;I
mean the Scarlet Grays&mdash;to a good deal of
expense in getting up their uniform&mdash;they’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
rich, you know! Rich isn’t the word. O they
could buy out a gold mine and not feel it.
Well, after all, they haven’t won a race. They
are going to play with us, you know&mdash;row, I
mean, and then they row with a set of mill&ndash;hands
at Campton. Well, their folks feel badly
because they don’t whip anybody, and Tripp
says his mother is all worked up about it.
Then Tripp asked, ‘Who is that rather heavy,
strong, well&ndash;built fellow in your crew, who
wears a stiff, round&ndash;top felt, and pulls a neat,
strong stroke too, for I saw him at it the other
day?’ Well, I knew my goods of course, and
I knew it was&mdash;you.”</p>

<p>Here Walter straightened up. The compliment
was very acceptable, and Chauncy’s quick
eyes saw it. This apt disciple of Baggs
appreciated the customer he was dealing with,
and repeated the opinion of the renowned
leader of the “Scarlet Grays.” Then he continued:
“After that, Tripp said, ‘I really feel
that we are at your mercy, especially with that
fellow against us&mdash;’” here Chauncy looked
slyly at Walter, who now stood erect as a king
at a coronation&mdash;“‘and I know it’s going to
make our fellers feel bad, and our folks feel bad,
and we shall surely lose that next race with
those mill fellers&mdash;and of course,’ he said, ‘I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
don’t mean that you shall lose by it&mdash;’ ‘Lose
what?’ said I, for a business man must have
his teeth cut. ‘Oh,’ said Tripp, ‘I am coming
to it. We don’t, or I don’t, care a snap for the
money. How much is it?’ Well, I told him;
and then yesterday, I got ten fishermen to
give each fifty cents, making between thirty
and forty dollars in all as&mdash;as subscribed. Of
course, Uncle Baggs is the heaviest name on
the list, and he didn’t hand it to me; but then
he’s good for twenty times twenty.”</p>

<p>Chauncy did not say whether he was good
for the money, or simply for a “subscription”;
a difference which all handlers of “subscription
papers” appreciate. All this time, Walter was
wondering what Chauncy was driving at.</p>

<p>“Of course I said I didn’t care about the
money, and Tripp said he didn’t; and Tripp said
that it should be all right. It should all be
paid over to us; or rather, the equivalent of it.
His folks would feel so badly if they lost
another race, and he knew his crew wouldn’t
have the heart to row that next race. ‘There,’
said he, ‘it shall be between us. If you and
that Plympton&mdash;that’s what you call him&mdash;will
just let up now and then on your rowing, and
pull easy, I think we can handle the rest of
you, and&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” said Walter abruptly.
“Sell out?”</p>

<p>He was now more erect than ever, straightening
up because stiffened by a sense of
indignation.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Plympton, you don’t understand,”
said Chauncy soothingly. He saw that he
had made a mistake. He “had put too many
goods on the market at once,” to use his own
phrase. Continuing his soothing tone of voice,
he said: “I can’t but pity the Scarlet Grays, if
they are feeling so badly and their folks are
stirred up, and ‘the town is down on ’em.’ Lang
says, why, his mother is just awful, he says,
and is real nervous. To oblige them, I’d give it
all away&mdash;I mean the prize.”</p>

<p>Such self&ndash;sacrifice! He was willing to throw
himself away&mdash;as far as this boat&ndash;race was concerned&mdash;all
for the sake of the Scarlet Grays’
feelings! In reality, he had already received
a present of “five dollars” from Tripp, and expected
another “five,” if successful with Walter.
Walter’s instincts were always in the
right place. A wrong thing coming to him, he
would condemn as wrong, and a right thing,
he would commend as right. But he was sympathetic,
while conscientious. He felt for the
individual sinner, while he disapproved of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
sin; and his sympathy might cloud the decision
of his judgment. When he thought of the
Scarlet Grays, the occasion of so much parental
disappointment, and the object of so much town
talk and town sport, he did pity “the poor
chaps,” as Chauncy whiningly labeled them
in his continued talk. Chauncy saw that he
was making an impression; that he was “putting
the right goods on the market, and the
right quantity;” and he continued to deliver
them in a sympathetic, pitying, self&ndash;sacrificing
tone. Suddenly Walter said to himself, “What
am I doing, allowing this fellow to talk so?
Where’s mother’s advice, ‘Honest, boy’? And
then that psalm I was reading from, this morning.
What did that say? Why, I can almost
seem to see it written in the sky!”</p>

<p>And looking away to the east all afire with
a shining crimson above the placid sea, he
seemed to see those words traced in the clouds:</p>

<p>“Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse
his way? By taking heed thereto according
to Thy word. With my whole heart, have I
sought Thee; O let me not wander from Thy
commandments.”</p>

<p>He turned quickly to Chauncy, and said in
a very positive way, “Aldrich, this thing is not
right; and I won’t have anything to do with it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“A&ndash;em!” said a voice.</p>

<p>Somebody was passing. The two young
men turned, and there was Capt. Barney, the
keeper of the life saving station. He passed
so near that they heard his step distinctly,
and yet he did not seem to be noticing them,
and rapidly moved away. Another moment,
he had turned the corner of an old mossy ledge,
tufted with a few bushes, and planted near the
water’s edge, now sparkling in the sunshine.
Chauncy was much confused for “a cool, clear&ndash;headed
business man,” as he judged himself to
be. Walter’s decided opinion, again abruptly
presented, had taken this soft talking, pitying
young trader by surprise. His face flushed, he
stammered, and he looked angry, as Walter
now spoke on his side:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Aldrich, this thing is wrong. I don’t care
about the money; but as I understand it, quite
a number of people, including those ten fishermen,
have given toward the race. They will
all take an interest in the race, and want The
Harbor crew to do its best, its honest best.
The people that take the trouble to come and
look at us will all expect us to do our best.
Why, I couldn’t do that thing,&mdash;let up on the
rowing, and then walk up the street and hold
up my head. As for those ninnies from Campton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
if they didn’t want to get licked, what
did they enter for? They were not obliged to
do it!”</p>

<p>Chauncy’s feelings were of a very mixed
character. He knew the proposition from the
other crew was not fair, and was really ashamed
of himself; and then he was mad because Walter
had shown himself to be more honest than
he. Walter now startled and confused him
with another proposition:&mdash;</p>

<p>“See here, Aldrich! If we get the prize&ndash;money,
I don’t want it any more than you.
Let’s give it away, say to start a library down
here at The Harbor, or somewhere in town; a
Town Library, I mean; of course, if the other
fellers in the crew are willing, and if&mdash;if&mdash;we
get it.”</p>

<p>This was another unexpected blow. Chauncy
already had begun to reckon what his share
of money from the race would probably be,
and had paid it over in his own mind toward a
pair of new trousers which he very much needed.
The failure of his wealthy uncle to pay Chauncy
for some reason all the money he owed his
clerk, interfered with the young man’s desire to
dress well on Sunday, at least. With a face
reddened by shame and anger, he had begun to
stammer out a reply to Walter, when his name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
was suddenly called. Turning, he saw the
keeper of the life saving station. At Capt.
Barney’s side was a stranger, who was introduced
as the superintendent of the life saving
station district, Mr. Eames.</p>

<p>“I want to get a little lumber at your mill,”
said the keeper, “if you could go with us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, <i>sir</i>!” replied Chauncy with an air of
patronage, to his patron. “I’m ready for a
trade.”</p>

<p>Off he strode, glad of any excuse for ending
a conversation in which he felt that he was
making little progress. In a jaunty way, he
sported his hat on one side of his head, and
moved as proudly as if going off to a bargain
of millions.</p>

<p>The boat&ndash;race had been announced to come
off the afternoon of the second day after this
interview between Walter and Chauncy, at the
hour of two, and it came off as promptly as
that hour itself. There was great interest
felt on the occasion. It seemed as if the sun
had given his golden disk an extra polish, so
bright was it; while the maples that dotted the
banks of the river flew their gay banners
from morning till night. All the able bodied
inhabitants that The Harbor could muster,
turned out with curious eyes and sympathetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
hearts. People from the outside world came
in vehicles of various kinds. Certain anxious
looking women tucked away in a coach, Walter
fancied to be the mothers of some of the
Scarlet Grays. But where were the latter?</p>

<p>“There they are!” shouted some one at
last, and round a rocky point in the river, came
the brilliant Scarlet Grays. Wearing their
scarlet caps, they looked like poppy stalks all
a&ndash;blossom, and conspicuous on their caps were
the dark letters S. G. Chauncy’s crew, consisting
of Chauncy, Walter, Don Pedro and
others, seemed very humble and tame beside
these brilliant floral oarsmen.</p>

<p>“Fact is we made a blunder,” observed
Chauncy, “in not having a uniform. But never
mind; merit wins. The trade does not always
go to the man in the best clothes.”</p>

<p>Remembering their late morning talk, Walter
could but think that a trade, and a bad one,
had almost gone in favor of these gaily decorated
seamen.</p>

<p>“Fellers, who are those coming?” asked
Chauncy, now slowly rising in his boat
and pointing out another that was now shooting
out of a little creek that emptied into the
river. “There are six rowing in it? Does
that mean a new entry? I suppose they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
a right to come, as we gave out that boats
could enter any time before the race.”</p>

<p>As the strange craft approached nearer, the
comments of Chauncy’s crew were more
curious and eager.</p>

<p>“Seaweed Townies!” exclaimed somebody.
All wonder was at an end, and disgust now
began. “Seaweed Town” was a nook of the
sea where half a dozen poor houses were
clustered on a rocky shore, and their inhabitants
were shabby people nicknamed “Seaweed
Townies.” The occupants of this boat
were boys of about sixteen, lean and scraggy,
with long, tangled black hair. Although not
equal in size to the members of Chauncy’s
crew, they had a certain wiry, tough look, and
their dark eyes flashed with an eager ambition
to win. The Scarlet Grays&mdash;and how brilliantly
they outshone these rivals who did not
indeed shine at all&mdash;hailed the advent of this
new “entry” with derision.</p>

<p>“Arabs!” they said with a sneer; but the
Seaweed Townies did not reply to them,
only looking more eager, and occasionally
giving their oars a nervous twitch.</p>

<p>Off darted the three boats at the appointed signal;
while the spectators applauded, and the very
maples seemed to be waving red handkerchiefs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t they look handsome!” screamed little
Miss P. Green. “Those Scarlet Grays are
be&mdash;be&mdash;witching.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Aunt Lydia with commendable
local pride. “Those little turkey gobblers
hain’t got no last to ’em! Jest see our
boys!”</p>

<p>“Our boys” certainly pulled with vigor.
Chauncy was now sincerely anxious to win the
laurels of the day, the arrival of the Seaweed
Townies having “toned up the market.”
Walter handled his oar with vigor, and Don
Pedro pulled with a grim resoluteness. Who
would praise the Seaweed Townies? Now
and then some sympathizing fellow, or
“Arab!” yelled from a boat in the river, a note
of cheer; but among The Harbor populace,
Jabez Wherren alone ventured a word of
commendation.</p>

<p>“Wall, now,” said Jabez, “them little chaps
from Seaweed Town do pull well. They
don’t seem to have any friends, but I shouldn’t
wonder&mdash;shouldn’t&mdash;wonder&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wall, what?” asked his spouse, impatiently
and meaningly.</p>

<p>“Don’t&mdash;don’t dare say,” replied Jabez, in a
tone of mock humility, squinting afresh at
the struggling crews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wall, <i>I</i> dare to say,” affirmed that warm
partisan, Aunt Lydia. “You ought ter be
ashamed of yourself!”</p>

<p>On sped the boats; stoutly pulled the oarsmen;
the spectators huzzahed; while the
maples, in silence, showed their warm admiration.
The Scarlet Grays took the lead at
the opening of the race, a fact that created
much excitement among the Campton carriages,
and, all a&ndash;flutter with fragrant white
handkerchiefs was the coach filled with ladies.
The “S. G’s” though, could not maintain their
position. They frantically struggled, and one
boy in his violent contortions even lost his
scarlet cap overboard, and pulled bare&ndash;headed
the rest of the way. When the stake&ndash;boat was
reached, and the contending craft rounded
this limit of their course, it was seen that
Chauncy’s crew was in the front place. This excited
The Harbor people to furious applause,
as soon as this fact was appreciated by them.</p>

<p>“It looks now,” said Aunt Lydia, “as if our boys
would win, and we’ll have a Libr’y down
here. Walter said, the boys all agreed, if they
got the money to give it toward a Public
Libr’y.”</p>

<p>“Hoo&ndash;ray for our boys!” screamed Miss P.
Greene, who had transferred her admiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
from the Scarlet Grays to the proper crew, and
wished to show her appreciation of all “educational
movements” as she termed them.
“Hoo&mdash;”</p>

<p>She was about to give another cheer, but a
tall butter firkin on which she had been standing
because it put her sharp nose and sharp
eyes just above the shoulders of other people,
here refused to serve as a lookout any longer.
It was something altogether apart from the
usual vocation of butter tubs; and naturally
asserting the right of revolution, or in this case,
of devolution, the tub canted over, and began
to roll; and down somewhere went Miss Green!
But while she went down, her voice went up,
the tongue asserting its accustomed supremacy
in this trying moment, even, and the cheer for
Chauncy’s crew ended in a scream. It made
a little stir among the spectators, but Jabez
Wherren was promptly on hand, and gallantly
fished the post&ndash;mistress up. He set the rebellious
butter firkin in its proper subordinate
place, and then set Miss Green on top of it,
where like a queen on her throne she received
the commiseration and congratulations of her
friends, who shuddered at her fall, and rejoiced
over her rise once more. I am afraid this fall
was ominous though, and my readers will soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
see for themselves. As the crews pulled away
in the river, Jabez Wherren, with a lack of
patriotism, declared that those “little Seaweed
fellers are givin’ it to our boat. Jest about
up with ’em and crowdin’ ’em hard!”</p>

<p>“There, Jabez!” said his spouse, who like the
butter firkin could only stand a certain amount
of strain, “ef you can’t talk any more sensible,
you’d better go hum.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no,” quietly remarked the grinning
Jabez, “I’m goin’&mdash;to see the upshot of this.”</p>

<p>Unlucky prophet! What did he want to use
that word “upshot” for? He had no sooner
spoken it, than there was an unhappy commotion
noticed in Chauncy’s boat. The crew had
been complaining of the new stroke which
Chauncy had introduced, but he had insisted
upon its use, saying it was very “scientific”;
that “just now it was the top thing in the
market, and would fetch a premium any day.”
When it was noticed in the race that the Seaweed
Townies were gaining on them, Chauncy,
who acted as captain of The Harbor crew, energetically
stimulated them by such remarks
as: “Muscle pays&mdash;now, boys!” “Don’t let
them have a cheap bargain. Hum&mdash;now!”
“Crowd the market! Give it to ’em!”</p>

<p>Finally he called out: “The stroke, boys!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Give them our stroke good! Science, boys!”
Every boy now watched his oar intently, and
pulled with all the “science” he could muster.
Chauncy aimed to set the example, and as he
strove to handle his oar with precision, he gave
it an unlucky violent jostle in the thole&ndash;pins.
One of these like the butter firkin on shore,
could not patiently submit to everything, and&mdash;broke!
There is such a thing in an oarsman’s
experience as “catching a crab.” The
oarsman concludes for some reason, generally
an irresistible one, to go over backwards, and
there catch his crab. As he tumbles into the
bottom of the boat, his feet naturally go up
and his arms also, while his head and shoulders
go down; and his whole figure may possibly
suggest a crab, with its crooked, wriggling
members. Chauncy now ignominiously “caught
a crab.” The great Solomon went down in
disgrace and disaster! The effect on The Harbor
spectators was as if the sun had gone into
mourning, while the maples all shivered in sympathy.
Chauncy quickly was up again, a new
thole&ndash;pin was inserted, and the crew gallantly
pulled away. But there were the
Seaweed Townies, ahead now by two boat
lengths! This advanced position, with grins
and giggles, those “dark&ndash;eyed monkeys,” as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Aunt Lydia promptly labeled them, stubbornly
maintained. Chauncy with frenzied efforts
tried to “work up the market,” but the
“Arabs” were victors. Lean and wiry as ever,
they triumphantly pulled their boat ashore.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, we whipped the Scarlet Grays,”
said Chauncy, wiping his face. “Fact was I
had from the very outset a strong desire to
whip them, and we succeeded.”</p>

<p>Chauncy’s assertion about his “strong desire”
would not bear investigation.</p>

<p>It was a fact, however, that Chauncy’s crew
had whipped the Scarlet Grays. Like poppies
that have been picked and then left out in a
frost, the “S. G.’s” pulled listlessly to the landing&ndash;place.</p>

<p>The crowd slowly dribbled away, the
people making their comments as they
retired.</p>

<p>“There’s a chance for a Public Library gone,”
moaned Miss P. Green.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” sympathetically wailed Aunt
Lydia and Mrs. Wherren.</p>

<p>“There, Jabez,” said his wife, “I hope another
time you won’t cheer fur the en’my so.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t cheer ’em, Huldy,” replied Jabez
in surprise.</p>

<p>“You made sympathizin’ remarks, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Aunt Lydia, and Miss P.
Green.</p>

<p>And poor Jabez went home, feeling that the
weight of responsibility for some great national
disaster rested on his shoulders. His
wife, “Huldy,” had remarkable success in making
Jabez feel that he was guilty, even when
innocent.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SURF&ndash;BOY.</p>

<p>The bright colors of October had faded
out of the landscape, and the soft
shades of November followed. With
November, came the festival of “All Saints’,”
reminding us of another life, and of those
who are with Christ. Not only are those
eminent in the Church suggested to us,&mdash;“apostles,”
“martyrs,” “confessors,” the constellations
in the sky, recognized by all,&mdash;but
how many separate stars better known
to us personally, look down through the
shadows of death’s night, and cheer us in
our pilgrim journey! These are our own beloved
dead, whose bright faces smile upon us,
and assure us that we are not forgotten. May
we not forget them, and may we prove our
memory in our better lives. “All Saints’”
passed, and the sharper days of November arrived
at The Harbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Walter’s duties at his Uncle Boardman’s had
been steadily continued, varied by occasional
gaps of leisure; and these he had filled up with
home visits. Sunday also was a big, blessed
gap of leisure, and each Sunday night had
brought its service at the Hall. The attendance
had been good. Mr. Raynham was earnest,
while reverent in his conduct of the service;
and the “choir”&mdash;how that had distinguished
itself! The “Cantate Domino,” “Benedic, anima
mea,” and other chants, they took up enthusiastically,
and lifted them very high on their
soaring wings of song.</p>

<p>“They make nothin’ of singin’ ’em,” affirmed
Aunt Lydia; which translated meant that they
made <i>something</i> of them; for promptness and
heartiness are never without a result, though
the melody may not be the sweetest.</p>

<p>Sunday over, Walter went again to his usual
duties in the store.</p>

<p>One Monday morning, there was an unusual
call at Uncle Boardman’s.</p>

<p>“Jotham Barney, I do declare!” said Aunt
Lydia, looking out of a kitchen window into the
yard. “Here he comes up to the back door.
I wonder what he wants here.”</p>

<p>A lifting of the outside door latch was now
heard, and a heavy step was planted on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
floor of the little entry. Then the inside door
swung open, and the keeper of the life saving
station entered Aunt Lydia’s sanctum.</p>

<p>“Good mornin’, Mis’ Blake.”</p>

<p>“That you, Jotham? Set down, do.”</p>

<p>“Much obleeged, but I’m in a bit of a hurry.
Where’s your husband?”</p>

<p>“He’s down in the mash field clearin’ up.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose I could see him, and I’ll go down.”</p>

<p>“He will be glad to see you, Jotham; but I
guess you’ll have to go down, for Boardman’s
that kind, he wouldn’t leave his work, for the
king.”</p>

<p>“That is all right, and that’s why he is so
forehanded.”</p>

<p>“Forehanded!” remarked Aunt Lydia, shaking
her head ominously when the keeper had
left the house. “I don’t know, I don’t know!
I expect that Belzebub’s a&ndash;swallerin’ up Boardman’s
property fast as he can gulp it down.”
This reference to Baggs did not have a soothing
effect on her feelings, and she wisely
changed her thoughts by going to the window
that faced the orchard. She watched the
keeper, as he took a path that followed an old
stone wall. Soon leaping this, he hurried
across a narrow field that was dotted with the
yellow stubs of cornstalks. Beyond this, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the lot which Aunt Lydia had designated
as the “mash field.” It bordered the broad,
flat marsh, beyond which flashed the blue,
bright river. It was a variety field in its crops,
yielding a little corn, more potatoes, and beans
mostly. “Clearin’ up” was no small task, as
it meant the removal of bean&ndash;poles, and an
indefinite quantity of vines. The latter went
no farther than a bonfire in one corner of the
field: and up to it Boardman Blake was now
venturing at intervals, thrusting into its smoke
and flames immense armfuls of dead vines. At
the time that the keeper of the station made
his appearance, Boardman was stoutly tugging
at a row of very obstinate bean&ndash;poles, and every
moment he grew redder in the face, while his
scanty breath issued in warm little puffs.</p>

<p>“Glad&mdash;to see ye,&mdash;Jothum. How&mdash;dy’e&mdash;do?”
ejaculated Boardman, still tugging away.</p>

<p>“Well as usual, thank ye. Got some tough
customers there?”</p>

<p>“We&mdash;e&mdash;ll,&mdash;yes!” said Boardman.</p>

<p>“Think&mdash;”</p>

<p>The world lost that last precious thought.
Here a provoking bean&ndash;pole that he had grasped,
suddenly broke, and in a great, fat heap, over
went Boardman, cutting Chauncy Aldrich’s
figure when in the boat&ndash;race he “caught a crab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Hurt&mdash;ye?” cried the keeper, rushing forward
and offering his assistance.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;no!” said Boardman laughing, and
rolling over as easily as Miss P. Green’s butter
firkin, on the day of the fatal boat&ndash;race. “The
pesky pole got the better of me.”</p>

<p>“Let me help you,” said the keeper, his
vigorous muscle quickly hoisting into an upright
attitude this “fallen merchant,” as
Chauncy would have called him.</p>

<p>“There!” puffed Boardman, resolutely resuming
work, and tugging at the stub of the broken
pole. “Now I’m ready for business, if I can
help you.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to see you about Walter.”</p>

<p>“Walter, my nephew?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Hope he has done nothing out of the way.
His folks would feel dreadful bad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no&mdash;no! jest the opposite. Fact is, I
want him at the station.”</p>

<p>Boardman looked up, and wiped his broad,
benevolent face.</p>

<p>“You don’t say! I thought Walter couldn’t
have been up to anything out of the way, for
he is as well meanin’ a boy as you often see.
And you want him at the station? Indeed!”</p>

<p>“You see, Squire”&mdash;a title the people gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Boardman when they wished to be specially
attentive, and it was always acceptable to
Boardman&mdash;“you see, Silas Fay, one of my
men, is not very well; but I want to hold on to
him as he is a powerful feller, and a good boatman.
I thought if Silas took a rest, a month
say, he would be able to come back and pull
through the winter. I thought for that month,
I might get your Walter.”</p>

<p>“Is he strong enough?”</p>

<p>“He has a good deal of strength for one of
his years, and every day he will be a&ndash;gainin’.
Jest look at him! I have watched him a good
deal. He is a good oarsman too. They say
he pulled fustrate at the race. Then I thought
he might like the money, and also that you
might spare him, as work at the saw&ndash;mill is
slack, and I knew you didn’t have to be there
so much, and could be more at the store. Then
that colored boy is with you, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, and I think I could get along.
We are not doing&mdash;well, you might say, we&mdash;we&mdash;are
doing&mdash;not a thing at mill. Baggs
has gone out West to look after some business.”</p>

<p>Boardman looked very despondent.</p>

<p>“Squire, look here.”</p>

<p>The keeper here dropped his voice, though
there was no occasion for it, as the only being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
that heard him was a musk&ndash;rat stealing along in
the shadow of the wall of a ditch near by. In
low, confidential tones, the keeper remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I think that&mdash;I don’t want to hurt your
feelin’s, but I must say it&mdash;I think Baggs will
bear a good deal of watchin’. Did you know
the men at the station had been lettin’ him
have their money?”</p>

<p>“Why, no.”</p>

<p>“But they have. He said he could give ’em
more per cent than the bank would, and so a
number of ’em, when paid off, took their cash
to Baggs. He’s a sly old crittur. One time,
he purtended he wasn’t particular ’bout havin’
any more, and one of ’em as good as begged
him to take his money, and Baggs made a good
deal of the fact that he calc’lated he was the
‘poor man’s friend,’ and on the whole, though
he didn’t want it, yet he would ‘’commodate’
him; and that’s the last the feller has seen of
it.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t Baggs pay interest?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was in the agreement that the int’rest
should stay and ‘’cumulate,’ he called it.
He’s a knowin’ one, that Baggs! Squire, I
wouldn’t resk too much.”</p>

<p>Boardman did not enjoy such advice, but he
was accustomed to it, as Aunt Lydia administered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
frequent doses. There was always a dose
the first thing in the morning, like the sulphur
and molasses some unfortunate children are
obliged to take; and other administrations during
the day, might be expected.</p>

<p>“Wall, let that go for what it is worth. To
go back, Squire, as I was a&ndash;sayin’ about Walter,
I thought you might spare him, this month,
say.”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;yes. I think I can.”</p>

<p>“Then, I’ll speak to him. You see one
reason why I’d rather have him in Silas’ place
a month&mdash;of course, I don’t s’pose he could be
spared mebbe, any longer time than that&mdash;one
reason, as I said, is that I think I can depend
on him. I heard him, one mornin’ before the boat&ndash;race,
say to Baggs’ nephew a thing&mdash;something
or other&mdash;wasn’t right, and he wouldn’t have
anything to do with it. I liked that in him.
I told the sup’rintendent of our station
deestrick who was on, all ’bout Walter, and
that I thought he would do as a substitute, and
I mentioned that leetle circumstance. The
sup’rintendent said it had the right ring. So,
Squire, if you are ’greeable, I’ll speak to
Walter.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing, Jotham, and I’m obliged to you
for your good opinion of my nephew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Not only was Boardman “‘greeable,” but so
was every one who was involved in the matter.
Aunt Lydia assented, though she declared she
should “miss him.” Don Pedro gave a solemn
smile, and said he would do all he could.
Walter’s parents were willing; and as for
Walter&mdash;he just sprang for the chance. He
met the proposition with all the enthusiasm
of his nature. That yellow building near the
beach fascinated him. The sea beyond was a
mystery that awed, and yet ever attracted
him. He had been reading about the life
saving service, and he wished with his own
eyes to look inside&mdash;not inside of a book, simply,
but the service itself. He went home to pass
“Thanksgiving,” that delightful family festival;
and after his return, one brilliant but chilly
November morning, he climbed up into his
Uncle Boardman’s high red wagon, and took
his seat by Don Pedro, who had been
commissioned to take Walter, and an old blue
chest, down to the station. Walter had found
this chest up in the garret, packed away under
the dusky eaves.</p>

<p>“It looks more sailor like than my trunk,”
reasoned Walter, “and I will ask the folks if
I can’t take it. Good! It has rope handles,
sailor&ndash;fashion. Just the thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>!”</p>

<p>The “folks” were willing, and without obtaining
the leave of the chest itself, this was
dragged out into the light, upset, dusted,
pounded on every side, and dusted again; and
after this rough, unceremonious treatment,
lugged down into Walters chamber. There, it
was neatly packed, and then removed to the red
wagon. Before it reaches the station, there
will be time enough to say something about
the late work of that department of Government
employ, into which Walter Plympton for
awhile has gone.</p>

<p>By the report of the life saving service for
1885, there were 203 stations planted on the
edge of that great kingdom of water whose
violence must so often be fought. Of these
stations, 38 were on the Lakes, 7 on the Pacific,
157 on the Atlantic, and 1 at the Falls of
the Ohio, Louisville, Kentucky.</p>

<p>These stations are grouped into districts:
those in Maine and New Hampshire, constituting
the first district; in Massachusetts, the second;
on the coast of Rhode Island and Long Island,
the third; and the New Jersey coast makes the
fourth. There is a large number of stations
in the last two districts, for they offer a
dangerous coast on which to trip up the great
commerce hurrying into and out of New York.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
As we go farther south, the coast from Cape
Henlopen to Cape Charles lies in the fifth district;
and that from Cape Henry to Cape Fear
River in the sixth. The eastern coast of Florida,
with the coast of Georgia and South Carolina,
is in the seventh, the Gulf coast in the
eighth. Lakes Erie and Ontario make the ninth
district; Lakes Huron and Superior the tenth;
Lake Michigan the eleventh; and the Pacific
coast constitutes the twelfth. Each district is
in the care of a superintendent, and over all is
the General Superintendent, Hon. Sumner I.
Kimball, whose headquarters are at Washington.
The service also has its Inspector, Capt.
J. H. Merryman, and there are twelve Assistant
Inspectors, for the twelve districts. Let us
now get up high enough in imagination to look
down on our rough coast, and watch the vessels
struggling with storm and surf while
the surfmen gallantly push out to their relief.
371 disasters were recorded at these stations,
and in the periled vessels, were 2,439 persons;
and only eleven were lost. Now let us look at
the property involved in these disasters. The
vessels and their cargoes were estimated to be
worth $4,634,380, and of this amount, there
was a saving of $3,379,583. There were 56
vessels totally lost. This is the last published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
report. The work at a life saving station
is of varied nature. There are not only
wrecks to be visited, but vessels coming too
near shore in the night time must be warned
off by the faithful patrolman’s signal light.
A vessel may be stranded, and need to be
“worked off.” If a fisherman’s dory, or a
millionaire’s yacht, should meet with any
kind of a disaster, if some unlucky traveler
by the sea may tumble into the water from
his little craft, if any party of mariners, disabled
for any reason, may need shelter and
refreshment, it is the life saving station that
is expected to furnish help for all the above
cases.</p>

<p>Let us now pack into a nutshell the results
of the work of these men, since this system
was inaugurated in 1871. There have been
2,918 disasters that involved property worth
$51,763,694, and there was a saving of
$36,277,929. Out of a total of 25,693 persons
involved in these disasters, 25,236 were saved;
and the department claims that it was not responsible
for the loss of 197. In the latter cases,
the stations were not open, or service was hindered
by distance. 4,829 persons were aided at
stations, and the days of relief afforded these
were 13,313. I would add that, the seventh district
is peculiar. It takes in the eastern coast
of Florida. Stations here are “provisioned
houses of refuge” in the care of keepers, but
without any crew. The coast is singular, and if
a vessel be stranded, the escape of the crew is
as a rule, comparatively easy. In the case
of such a disaster as the above, to a crew, their
special peril is from hunger and thirst, when they
have reached a shore very scantily inhabited.
Guide posts are set up for the benefit of such
castaways, directing them to the station or
lighthouse that may be nearest.</p>

<p>The vast field of work occupied by the life
saving service, let us try to grasp with our
thoughts. Recall once more the stations established;
the figures, too, that represent the life
and property already saved; and think also of
the vast interests still at stake in the ships that
are sailing, and the crews that are climbing
their rigging. The boy who sits in the red
wagon by the side of Don Pedro, is coming to
help with his young, strong muscles, and nimble
wits, that force of about fifteen hundred, to&ndash;day,
whose noble mission it is to fight the sea, and
rescue the life and property it would destroy.
The red wagon bumps and jolts over the rough
little lane winding down to the station, and finally
halts, as Don Pedro shouts to the horses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
“Whoa, dah!” The blue chest with its clumsy
rope handles is lowered to the ground, and
then obediently accompanies Walter and Don
Pedro into the station.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="pch">ON HIS BEAT.</p>

<p>Keeper Barney and his family of surfmen
were at breakfast as Walter
entered. They were seated about
a table on which were two huge steaming
dishes,&mdash;one of biscuit, and the other of
fried potatoes. By each surfman’s plate, was a
cup of hot coffee. A ready chorus of welcome
went up from these modern knights of the sea.
“How are ye, Walter?” sang out the keeper.
“Hullo!” “Good mornin’!” “Come in!
come in!” were the various styles of greeting;
while Charlie Lawson, the cook, shouted, “You
look thin as a shadder! Set down, and have
something to fill you out!”</p>

<p>“I’m much obliged,” replied Walter. “I have
been to breakfast, though.”</p>

<p>“That means,” explained the keeper, “that
he was out last night practicin’ on a beat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
so took an <i>early</i> cup of coffee; but we will
show him to&ndash;night what a <i>real</i> beat is.”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” said Tom Walker. “Them
fancy beats don’t amount to nothin’, beside the
real article.”</p>

<p>Walter felt at home at once, and declared
that he guessed he would try “Cook Charlie’s
biscuit.”</p>

<p>“Biscuit! Try them fried taters too. One
of ’em would keep you a&ndash;goin’ a hull day,” declared
the cook.</p>

<p>“You look as if they had done a good work
for you,” said Woodbury Elliott to the cook.
Something had fatted up “Cook Charlie” as he
was generally called. But what business has
a cook to be lean? The presiding genius of
the kitchen, certainly ought to give in his own
body proof of his skill. A lean cook is an inconsistency;
while in a fat cook there is a fitness.
And then what right has a cook to be
cross? A good dinner begets a good temper;
and the cook ought to be sweet&ndash;natured always.
A lean, cross cook, is an inconsistency. Cook
Charlie, was of the kind that harmonizes with
the cheerful, comforting nature of the kitchen
stove. All the surfmen were at the breakfast
table excepting Silas Fay, whose place Walter
intended to temporarily fill. There was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
sandy haired keeper, and there was Tom
Walker, with his big bushy beard,&mdash;a shaggy
kind of an animal. Next to Tom, sat Woodbury
Elliott, his blue eyes flashing out occasional
glances of welcome toward Walter. If
Cook Charlie was fat, “Slim” Tarleton was
lean; and his first name was bestowed upon
him on account of this peculiarity. He was
Capt. Barney’s bony neighbor on the left.
Next to Slim, came two brothers, Seavey, and
Nathan Lowd. They were quiet, inoffensive
young men, whose peculiarity was a grin on
every possible occasion, excepting a funeral.
They were twins, resembling one another
closely; but showed this difference, that Nathan
grinned more than Seavey. There was one
more at the table,&mdash;Joe Cardridge, a black&ndash;haired,
black&ndash;eyed man, on whose face was a
cynical expression, as if he was continually out
of humor with the world, and wished to show
it by a sneer. Nobody liked his discontented,
jealous disposition, and it was the keeper’s purpose
to get rid of him at the first opportunity.
He was an excellent boatman, and this merit
had secured him the position of surfman. It
was true indeed of all the crew; their knowledge
of boating, gained in many trips after cod
and pollock, halibut and haddock, constituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
their special fitness for the life saving service.
They were strong, hardy, muscular fellows,
and Slim Tarleton&mdash;bony, but tough&mdash;was no
exception.</p>

<p>After breakfast, the keeper led Walter upstairs.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you where you will bunk,
Walter, and I guess you had better take Silas’
bed. Here it is.”</p>

<p>“Who sleeps next?”</p>

<p>“Woodbury Elliott there, and Tom Walker
on this side. Each man of the crew is
numbered, and you will take Silas’ number, six.
You are Surfman Six.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. Now, I’ve been round over the
station, and know it pretty well. Could you
just give me an insight into the boat&ndash;room,
more of an idea of it?”</p>

<p>“Sartin. Let’s come down now.”</p>

<p>From the kitchen or living&ndash;room, on the
first floor, one passed directly into the large
boat&ndash;room; and that immediately proclaimed the
nature of the building, and also the work of its
occupants. In the center, was the surf&ndash;boat,
twenty&ndash;six feet long. At the stern and bows,
were air&ndash;chambers.</p>

<p>“That long steering&ndash;oar is twenty&ndash;two feet
long, isn’t it? Somebody said so.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">“<i>This was worn about the body under the
arms</i>”<span class="reduct" style="font-weight: normal;">(p. <a href="#Page_197">197</a>)</span>.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. Walter. It gives me a tremendous
purchase when I set in the starn to steer.”</p>

<p>“Of course you have six oars, and then
there are two spare ones.”</p>

<p>“Jest so.”</p>

<p>Each oar was stamped, “U. S. L. S. S.,”
whose translation is United States Life Saving
Service. On each seat was a cork jacket, consisting
of two rows of cork blocks secured to a
belt of canvas. This was worn about the
body under the arms.</p>

<p>“That means,” said Walter, “all ready for
use, any moment.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we may be wanted any hour, and we
can’t go out, service&ndash;time, unless we put those
jackets on.”</p>

<p>“So Tom Walker told me. Let me see&mdash;Oh,
there’s the axe Tom said you kept in the boat;
and there’s a hatchet, and you have got ‘Uncle
Sam’s’ mark on them.”</p>

<p>“Yes. There’s a rudder too, which we can
use in smooth water. This is a surf&ndash;boat, but
there are in the service some life&ndash;boat stations.
On the Lakes, and Pacific coast, you find ’em.
Life&ndash;boats are better for a shore that is bold,
where the water runs deep.”</p>

<p>Along the right hand wall of the boat&ndash;room,
extended a miscellaneous collection of apparatus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
There was a mortar for shooting a
line to a wreck, the ball used being a twenty&ndash;four
pound round shot. There were shovels
and a Merriman rubber suit. Wound ingeniously
and carefully on pins, were long
coils of shot&ndash;line, that could be slipped off any
moment, and sent whizzing and flying behind
an iron ball. There were also long coils of
rope, to be used in completing the connection
between a wreck and the shore. Of the three
sizes, the largest, a four&ndash;inch cable, was employed
with the life&ndash;car, and a three&ndash;inch cable
with the breeches buoy.</p>

<p>“There it is!” exclaimed Walter enthusiastically,
as he crossed to the left of the surf&ndash;boat
and looked up at the life&ndash;car. This was
suspended from the ceiling. It resembled a
boat, but it was covered. In the center of the
cover or roof, was an opening. At each end of
the car, were air&ndash;chambers.</p>

<p>“Woodbury Elliott says four small persons, or
three large ones, can get in there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we calc’late to stow that number
away.”</p>

<p>“And that opening is the manhole.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and when you are in, you can fasten
the cover from the inside, and be tight as a fly
inside a drum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“I used to wonder how they could breathe,
till I found out there were little air&ndash;holes in the
top.”</p>

<p>“Sartin.”</p>

<p>“And this is the cart,” said Walter, nodding
toward a stout hand&ndash;cart.</p>

<p>“Yes, and you see she is all packed for sarvice
any moment.”</p>

<p>Here the keeper laid his broad, hard hand
on the apparatus in the cart. There was the
breeches buoy, consisting of a large cork ring,
from which drooped very stout, but very short
legs, or “breeches.” A Lyle gun, lighter than
a mortar, and used for shooting a line to a
wreck, projected its nozzle from the heap in
the cart.</p>

<p>“There is the cartridge&ndash;box,” said Walter.
“And I suppose of course the cartridges are
there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, all ready, and two dozen primers
are in there.”</p>

<p>“Pickaxe and shovel, and tackle and fall,”
murmured Walter.</p>

<p>Yes, these were carried by the cart, and Walter
saw little tally&ndash;boards, inscribed with directions
to a shipwrecked crew, for the proper
fastening of ropes to the vessel.</p>

<p>“Could I look into the closet where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Coston signals and rockets are?” inquired
Walter.</p>

<p>“Round this way,” replied the keeper, who
was pleased to notice that Walter knew so
much about the apparatus at the station. He
threw open a door, and a drawer also. In this
closet, were various pyrotechnic treasures, serviceable
with their brilliantly flashing fires for
the work of the surfmen.</p>

<p>The store of curiosities in the boat&ndash;room had
not been exhausted yet. Near the door of the
living&ndash;room, was a row of shots that were
adapted to the Lyle gun, one end to rest on
the powder, and in the other end was a shank
with an eye to which the line was fastened. On
the left side of the room, was a four&ndash;wheeled
carriage for the hauling of the boat. Hanging
from the walls were ropes and oil suits. There
was also another closet of supplies. There
were patrol lanterns, colored signal lanterns,
speaking trumpets, twenty&ndash;four pound shot for
the mortars; and what serviceable piece of apparatus
was <i>not</i> there?</p>

<p>“Glad to see you know so much about this
’ere room, Walter,” said the keeper.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ve found out what I could,” replied
“Surfman Six.”</p>

<p>During any visit at the station, Walter had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
gone about with two observant eyes, and a
tongue that was not ashamed to ask questions.
What he learned, he packed away for use in
his retentive memory.</p>

<p>“You remember your beat when your father
let you go one night with Tom Walker?” said
the keeper.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“All right. At the same time this evening,
I’ll get you ready, and you can patrol that
same side of the station.”</p>

<p>At eight o’clock, Walter stood before the
keeper like a knight that some king was equipping
and sending out for special service.</p>

<p>“I am all ready,” said the young surfman, his
bright, hazel eyes flashing like two of “Uncle
Sam’s” patrol lanterns on a dark night. He
wore a cap that Aunt Lydia had lined with
soft, warm flannel for this particular duty.
His feet were encased in rough, but strong
boots; and his clothes, though rough like the
boots, were thick, with extra linings, furnished
by the same feminine skill as that which lined
his cap. He had buttoned up his stout fishing&ndash;jacket
and now awaited the keeper’s orders.</p>

<p>“There,” said the keeper. “Here is your
time&ndash;detector, and here’s your Coston signal.
You know where the key to the detector is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
kept, I guess I’ve given you directions enough
’bout lettin’ off your Coston signal ef you see a
vessel too near shore, or ef you want to signal
to a craft in any trouble. Wall, good luck!”</p>

<p>Out into the quiet, cool November night,
Walter promptly stepped. He halted one moment
at the outside door. There was a moon
somewhere in the sky, and somewhere behind
the station; and it threw its light on that part
of the shore and the sea which Walter fronted.</p>

<p>“How low the tide runs!” thought Walter.
Beyond that rocky rim against which the surf
daily fretted, turning over and over like a
wheel trying to grind out of the way an obstacle,
now stretched the uncovered sands. He
could easily mark off with his eye the dry sand,
and then the wet sand glistening in the moonlight.
Then came the surf, a tumble of silver.
Beyond were dark, swelling, threatening folds,
forever coming up out of the sea as if to drown
the earth; and yet forever breaking down into
white surf that rolled away in an impotent
wrath. Beyond all, was an untroubled surface
of light and peace; this in turn ending in a
dark, hazy belt that encircled the horizon.
There were two lighthouses whose red fires
flashed through this belt of haze, and jeweled
it. Above, were the stars, soft and peaceful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will walk down on the sands,” thought
the young patrol, and his light was soon flashing
above the floor of wet, glistening sand.
With keen eyes, he searched the surface of the
sea for some sign of danger; but the sea was
innocent of all disturbance save the tumbling,
roaring surf at his feet. He saw a light up
the beach that shifted its place&mdash;a kind of firebug
crawling away; but he knew it was only
the lantern of the other patrolman as he slowly
walked his beat. What a sense of responsibility
came down on Walter’s shoulders! It
seemed as if he would be held accountable for
any disaster to the world’s shipping on his side
of the station; while Slim Tarleton must look
out for all harm that threatened navigation on
his, the westerly side of the globe. After a
while, this sense of responsibility lightened.
He was not accountable for <i>all</i> the disasters on
this, the easterly side of the globe, but only on
the ocean between Walter Plympton, surfman,
and Old England. This stretch of jurisdiction
gradually narrowed. It became only the ocean
that he could see. This, though, was so quiet,
lamb&ndash;like, lustrous, that it dulled all sense of
alarm; and Walter began to think of something
else, as he plodded along. There were the
stars. How quiet it was up in their sphere!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s Orion!” he exclaimed, tracing the
outlines of that celestial hunter, whose acquaintance
he had made in the academy.</p>

<p>“Where’s the Great Bear?” he said. And
there it was; its fires mild as dove’s eyes, that
night. Then he hunted up the North Star,
the Pleiades, and other worthies. Having finished
his astronomy, and as no vessel out at
sea sent up any rockets, and no vessel near the
shore needed his warning lantern, since the
moon hung out a better one, he began to watch
the shadows of rocky bluffs, thrown down on
the sands. These were huge masses of blackness
projected across the shining sands, into
which ran little rivulets of gold, where the
water, left in pools, tried to make its way down
to the sea again. These golden streams, though,
could not wash away the great, ebony shadows.</p>

<p>“There’s the Crescent!” exclaimed Walter.
He could make out its dark ledges, and he located
also the probable neighborhood of the
Chair. He plodded along in his uneventful
walk. He reached the houses at the end of his
beat, and turned aside to hunt up the particular
building where he might expect to find the
key of his detector.</p>

<p>“When I patrolled this beat that night with
Tom Walker, I had no idea I would ever be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
coming after that key to&ndash;night. Ah, there she
is now!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The key was in its accustomed place. Walter
seized it, thrust it into the hole in the detector,
turned it, and proudly made his first
record as a surfman. Then he retraced his
way to the sands, still glistening in the moonlight,
and slowly trudged back to the station.
When at the close of his long watch, he wearily
passed upstairs, and dropped into his warm
bed, he went readily to sleep, but not into oblivion.
He was busily dreaming, dreaming
that he was a knight, and King Barney was
dressing him in armor. Then he thought that
armed with shield and spear and sword, he
went out upon the beach to fight the perils of
the sea. These took the form of a monster
wriggling out of the surf; and as in the old
Grecian fable, Perseus was moved to rescue the
maiden Andromeda from a sea&ndash;horror, so he
was striving to save May Elliott, bound like
Andromeda to the rocks on the shore. The
battle was a long one and it did not come off
till toward morning. He was suddenly aroused
by&mdash;was it an angry stroke from a claw of the
sea&ndash;dragon? It seemed so to Walter; and looking
up in a shivering horror, expecting to see
the most diabolical face ever invented, wasn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
he delighted to see&mdash;Tom Walker’s shaggy
head:</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;h&mdash;Tom! That you! Well, if I ain’t
glad to see you!”</p>

<p>Tom roared.</p>

<p>“Well, if I don’t call that a cordial greetin’!
Ha&mdash;ha! Folks are apt to feel t’other way,
when waked up. Glad to see me! Ha&mdash;ha!
Well, I’m glad to see you. Come, breakfast’s
ready. Cook Charlie’s taters will soon be
cold as the heart of a mermaid, if you ever
dream of sich things.”</p>

<p>Walter did not say whether he had been
dreaming of such a character.</p>

<p class="pch">UNDER FIRE.</p>

<p>Boardman Blake sat in his store,
patiently holding his hands in his
lap, and waiting for a customer. Indeed,
there seemed to be nothing else that
he could very well do. He was not needed in
the barn, for Don Pedro was there, looking
faithfully after oxen and cows; after “Old
Jennie,” the mare, also. Boardman had just
brought from the well all that Aunt Lydia
needed in her department&mdash;“two heapin’ pails
of water.” He was tired of looking at the few
books on the shelves in the store, and he
had gone through the <i>County Bugle</i> from its
first note to its last one. As no customer arrived,
his only occupation was to nurse his
hands in his lap, and wait in hope. If
Boardman had waited until an actual customer
had arrived, there would have been a good deal
of nursing. He supposed at first it was a customer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
when he heard a footstep at the door, and
then caught the tinkle of the watchful bell.</p>

<p>“Ho, Walter, that you? I am glad to see
you,” and as Uncle Boardman welcomed the
young man, he expressed his pleasure in a very
beaming smile and a very firm hand&ndash;grip.
Walter explained the errand about certain
goods which Keeper Barney wanted Uncle
Boardman to send to the station, and the conversation
then became a personal one.</p>

<p>“Well, Walter, how do you like the surf
business?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have enjoyed it so far. It’s not all
play, though.”</p>

<p>“No, no! It’s a rough&ndash;and&ndash;tumble life when
the winter sets in. However, I would make
the best of it.</p>

<p>“Oh, I mean to do that, uncle.”</p>

<p>Here Uncle Boardman looked out of the window,
and twirling his hands in his lap, talked
away on this subject of making the best of
things.</p>

<p>“Now, at the station you won’t find everything
to your mind. You won’t like all the
men; but then you can make a good deal of
what you do like; and what you don’t like, you
can just look over it, and try not to mind it,
Walter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“I know it. There’s Joe Cardridge. I don’t
take to him a bit; but I try not to mind him.
And as for Tom Walker and Woodbury Elliott,
I could do anything for them. There’s Cook
Charlie&mdash;he’s a jolly team, and the Lowds,
they’re great grinners, and the men make
a deal of fun of them; but they’re good&ndash;hearted
as the days are long. I like Slim Tarleton.”</p>

<p>“Pretty hard trampin’ backwards and forwards,
some nights, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so; but then I say, ‘Well,
there will be a warm bed when I get through,’
and then in the morning, I can’t say I enjoy
getting up, turning out into a cold room; but I
say, ‘There’s a lovely hot breakfast downstairs,’
and I pop up quicker.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, Walter. I guess you’re getting
the hang of the house. How&mdash;how do you
come on since&mdash;” Uncle Boardman hesitated.
He felt the pressure of a certain amount of responsibility,
as he stood in the place of Walter’s
father and mother, and he wished to ask
about his religious life.</p>

<p>“Since&mdash;since you were confirmed, Walter?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I try to do right, uncle, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You stick to your prayers and your Bible?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I miss my church, Sundays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Well, Walter, do the best you can, your
duty toward God and toward man; but do it
naturally.”</p>

<p>“What, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why, I mean by that&mdash;let me see how I
shall put it? It seems to me that I might&mdash;of
course I don’t intend it&mdash;be too&mdash;too conscious
of my religion. Seems to me a man may be
painfully so, going round with a kind of holier&ndash;than&ndash;thou
way. Do you understand me?”</p>

<p>“I think I do.”</p>

<p>“Just be natural. Let your religion just take
possession of you, and then come out just&mdash;just
as song comes out of a bird. I don’t see
why it shouldn’t, for religion is the happiest thing
in the world. Sometimes, I find a man, and he
makes me feel that he is so dreadful good, why
it would be taking a liberty, to laugh in his presence.
Now that man is sort of painfully conscious
of his religion, all the time a&ndash;worrying
about it and a&ndash;fussing over it; and makes the
people uneasy all round him. Just be natural,
Walter, and without your fussing over it, it
will come out easy and smooth as a bird’s
singing. I tell you, Walter, a good kind of religion
is one that says when you weigh a thing,
‘Sixteen ounces make a pound;’ and when you
talk, ‘Thou shalt not bear false witness against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
thy neighbor;’ and when it comes to our no
licensing, that says, ‘Woe unto him that giveth
his neighbor drink, that puttest thy bottle to
him and makest him drunken also.’ Do you
understand, Walter? Be thorough in your religion.
Pray, but act as you pray.”</p>

<p>“I want to do that way.”</p>

<p>This was the answer Walter made audibly.
What he added silently, and what he repeated
as he was going to the station, was this: “Uncle
Boardman can afford to talk, for Uncle Boardman
practices. I don’t care how much I have of
that man’s religion. ‘Make the best of things,’
he said. I wonder if he isn’t having a hard
time in his mill business with Baggs, and if it
don’t come hard to be cheerful!”</p>

<p>It did “come hard be cheerful,” for Uncle
Boardman had only been a fly in the web of
that spider, “Belzebub” Baggs. To erect the
mill and inaugurate the business there, Uncle
Boardman had been obliged to put on his home
a mortgage, additional to one already existing.
The first burden, the house might have sustained;
but under the additional pressure of
the second, the house threatened, as a piece of
of Blake property, to collapse. Did not the fly
know he was walking into a spider’s web, when
“Belzebub” came, and spoke soft words, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
made extravagant promises? The fly was suspicious,
but the spider showed him a recommendation
from two men of excellent judgment
whom he personally knew. Enticed by the assurance
that B. Baggs was a man of business, a
man of money, and a man of morals, the fly
walked into the spider’s web. Discovering his
mistake, Uncle Boardman was now trying to
rectify it; refusing to place any more money in
the mill enterprise. And didn’t the spider
threaten vengeance! Didn’t he turn on the
poor fly, and torment him with the fact that he
held a certain note against him almost due,
and whose payment he would press!</p>

<p>“Oh!” thought Uncle Boardman. “It’s that
note for $500, which I lost somehow, and then I
gave him another. Well!”</p>

<p>That was all the fly could say. He knew he
had made mistakes, but they were mistakes
based on the opinion of those whom he supposed
he could trust. Now that the toils of
the spider were closing about him, he was
doing his best to struggle out of them.</p>

<p>“I won’t, though, make others just miserable
with my troubles,” he declared. “I won’t
give up. I’ll&mdash;I’ll&mdash;”</p>

<p>When he reached this place, Boardman Blake
always looked up; and amid the storm clouds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
steadily gathering, not slowly but rapidly increasing,
he could see one little place that held
a star.</p>

<p>“I’ll trust my Heavenly Father,” he said, trying
to be cheerful, patiently bearing Aunt Lydia’s
reflections, (those were rather gingery at first),
good&ndash;naturedly standing up, and taking the
raillery of his neighbors also. Aunt Lydia!
She <i>was</i> gingery at first, peppery even, and
that of the cayenne sort, but when she understood
the nature of the influence brought to
bear upon her husband, that he had been
guided by the judgment of others, who
were supposed to be wiser, she sheathed her
tongue in all possible charity. She played the
part of the true wife, and silently looking at
him through the eyes of a woman’s pity, stood
by him, and defended him, with all of a woman’s
devotion and courage.</p>

<p>As Walter neared the station, there was a
sneer leaning against the door, and this sneer
was two&ndash;legged: it was Joe Cardridge. It was
a mild December day, and he was lazily enjoying
its sunshine. As Walter approached, he
superciliously looked him over, and said “Hullo,
surf&ndash;boy!”</p>

<p>“How are ye!” replied Walter pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Surf&ndash;boy” was a title, which, spoken in Joe’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
sneering way, Walter did not fancy. If Tom
Walker had roared it out, Tom would have put
into it a tone of hearty good&ndash;will; and Walter
would have worn the name gladly. Joe added
a sneer to it, and the title galled Walter.
However, he kept his temper under, and always
addressed Joe courteously. The other surfmen
noticed Joe’s manner, and silently criticised it
by treating Walter’s youth with all the greater
considerateness.</p>

<p>On one occasion when Joe contemptuously
and with the spirit of a bully had flung this title
at him, Slim Tarleton remarked, “Hullo, Walter!
You’ve got a lot of strength, I know.
You have got master arms. We’ve got an old
stump in our cow pasture, and I mean to tell
father to let you try on it when we are takin’
up stumps.”</p>

<p>There was no Slim standing at the station
door to offset Joe’s present sneer with the tender
of another stump.</p>

<p>“Ben movin’ the world, boy?” continued
Joe.</p>

<p>“I have been up to Uncle Boardman’s,” replied
Walter.</p>

<p>“How is his mill gettin’ on? ‘A fool and
his money is soon parted,’ they say.”</p>

<p>“He is not a fool,” said Walter resolutely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
“I believe if he had an honest man to deal
with, he would get along.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” remarked Joe sneeringly.</p>

<p>Several of the surfmen now came to the door,
tempted by the mild air, whose softness seemed
to be on sea and land, softening all glaring
color and over all roughness throwing a veil
of purplish haze. It was one of the fine effects
of that scenic painter, Nature.</p>

<p>Who of those present understood that Joe
Cardridge was not only an ally of the great
Baggs, but also his hired&mdash;I can hardly say
paid&mdash;agent? It was he that had induced a
number of the men to intrust their money with
Baggs; and on every man’s money he had been
promised a commission.</p>

<p>“I most&ndash;er&ndash;wish I had taken out my kermission
fust, afore sendin’ Baggs the money,” Joe
had said; but it was too late to make changes.
He still lived, though, in the hope that out of
those exhaustless money fountains Baggs was
reputed to own, a golden stream might run
some day into Joe Cardridge’s pocket. Feeling
that he was the representative of the great
house of Baggs, he did not fancy the nature of
Walter’s remark, knowing its meaning. However,
the thunder storm raging under his vest
he prudently concealed in the presence of Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Walker, Cook Charlie, and Woodbury Elliott.
Although he had received no pay from the
great mercantile house employing him, he
meant in its behalf to give “pay,” in an underhand
fashion to the young fellow now
insulting Baggs, as he thought.</p>

<p>“Fellers,” he said, “it’s pleasant, and the
grass is thick and dry; and it won’t hurt if we
git tumbled; and let’s have a rastle.”</p>

<p>The proposition of a friendly wrestle did not
seem unpleasant to these young fishermen,
proud of their muscle, and ambitious to show it.</p>

<p>“I’m willin’,” said Tom Walker, gaping, and
at the same time ostentatiously throwing up a
pair of brawny arms.</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Woodbury Elliott, straightening
up, and bringing into firm outline his
splendid frame.</p>

<p>“So&mdash;so&mdash;am I,” said Cook Charlie, waddling
about; “pervided&mdash;you let me beat.”</p>

<p>This proposition was welcomed with a laugh,
but it was instantly followed by another from
Joe.</p>

<p>“Come, surf&ndash;boy, let’s you and me try.”</p>

<p>“Surf&ndash;boy!” growled Tom Walker. “He
has got a lot of strength, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m willing,” said Walter pleasantly
“Any time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Joe was the older and the taller of the two,
but Walter was as heavy, and his frame was
more compact. Joe’s bones had been put together
loosely. If Walter could have looked
down to the bottom of Joe’s dark, evil eyes,
he would have read this determination there:
“I’ll punish this boy smartly ’fore I git through
with him to&ndash;day.” Walter however saw no
such sinister spirit, and he only said, “Ready!”
The two gripped, and quickly Joe came to the
ground in a heap. Joe looked angry when he
rose. “Let’s try that agin!” he said.</p>

<p>Woodbury noticed the anger in Joe’s face,
and called out, “Fair play, fair!”</p>

<p>Joe made no answer, but renewed his effort,
only to make a worse heap on the ground than
before. When he rose the second time, he was
furious with wrath and immediately struck at
Walter. The “surf&ndash;boy” though, quietly pinioned
his arms and laid him on the ground a
third time. Rising again, his fury was his
master, and he would have thrown himself on
Walter, but Tom Walker and Woodbury Elliott
planted themselves before Joe, and called
out to him to stop.</p>

<p>“I challenge&mdash;him!” said the almost breathless
Joe. “I want&mdash;to&mdash;try&mdash;it&mdash;in fightin’
fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t fight,” said Walter. “But I can
take care of myself if I am attacked.”</p>

<p>“You are afeared!”</p>

<p>“Quiet, Joe!” said Tom. “He has come off
fust best, and he is not afraid; and he could use
you all up, and I ’vise you to keep quiet. You
ought to be ashamed of yourself that you can’t
play fair. Here comes the keeper, too.”</p>

<p>Hearing this, Joe stumbled off into the station,
looking like a disgraced animal, which
he really was. He muttered vengeance however,
as he stole away.</p>

<p>“Didn’t that boy carry himself well?” said
Tom to Woodbury, as they strolled back of the
station. “I’ve been a&ndash;watchin’ him and he has
stood Joe’s mean fire like a hero. I think he
means to do the right thing.”</p>

<p>“No doubt about that; but I guess he felt
pretty well stirred up.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. I imagine he jest felt like bilin’
over; but he didn’t show it more than the outside
of an iron pot, where the bilin’ is. I think
he did well. He jest conquered that Joe, and he
conquered himself; and I think I could more
easily give ten lickin’s of the fust sort, to one of
the second.”</p>

<p>As for Walter, he had entered the station,
gone upstairs, and was looking out of a window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
that faced the west, where the sun was
frescoing the misty walls of the sky with
daintiest shades. He was in no quiet mood.
He was sorry that he had consented to any
trial of strength ending so unpleasantly. He
was sorry to find out that under the roof with
him, was an avowed enemy. The world looks
friendly to the young, and it is a bitter discovery
to hear lions roaring about our path.
Walter resolved, though, he would try the harder
to do only the thing that was right; and as
he stood with his face to the flaming sky, he
asked God to help him.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">TWO BAD CASES.</p>

<p>Old Capt. Elliott, so the people called
him, could not climb a certain stairway.
That was not so strange, for it
was the stairway of a new life, and amendment
is sometimes the hardest thing one can attempt.
And yet it does not seem as if a little piece of
paper, would have so hindered Capt. Elliott&mdash;a
little piece of paper in his pocket&mdash;for it bore
him down as if it had been a mill&ndash;stone round
his neck, and climb, he could not. Say rather,
climb he <i>would</i> not. The facts were these. He
had been very much agitated by the services at
the Hall. They were a glass to his soul,
in which he had looked, and had seen what
a needy, miserable being he was. He resolved
he would begin a new life, and he climbed one
step in that stairway&mdash;the step of prayer. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
thought he had climbed another step, which
is just as important, repentance; that he had
begun to leave behind him old sins and was
on the way to speedy improvement. But a call
one evening from Miss P. Green led him to
think otherwise. She suddenly appeared at
his door, interrupting him while he was praying,
her bright eyes flashing and her little curls
dancing, and handing him a letter, remarked,
“I found this in the mail, Cap’n, and none of
your folks were down, and as I was over this
way, I thought I would bring it along.”</p>

<p>“Thank ye,” he replied gruffly, and taking
the proffered note, he turned away, leaving
Miss P. Green on the broad stone steps before
his door.</p>

<p>She withdrew her bright eyes and her dancing
little curls, saying, “There, I should have
thought he might have said, ‘It’s from so&ndash;and&ndash;so.’
That would have been some pay;
but <i>I</i> know! It’s from Boardman Blake. I
can tell his handwriting a mile off. I wonder
what he is writing for, when he might
come himself.”</p>

<p>Capt. Elliott also wondered; but some things
we can say better with our pens than we can
with our tongues, and this was Boardman’s
situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man forced open the envelope with
his big fingers, and read this:</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">“<span class="smcap">Capt. Elliott</span>;</p>

<p class="pbq">“<i>Dear Sir</i>,&mdash;I am aware that the time on my mortgage is
up, and I know you have a right to come over and take my
house. I thought perhaps you might give me a little time,
as it is very hard just now to raise any money. If you
could do this, it would be a great favor to me. I am a good
deal worried about it, and am sorry you can’t have your
money. Hoping you can oblige me, I am,</p>

<p class="pr6">“Truly yours,</p>
<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Boardman Blake.</span>”</p>

<p class="p1">“Can’t pay!” sneered the captain. “How
does he get money to live on? How does he
s’pose I can live? Wants a little time? Well,
hasn’t he had it? It is that old mill into
which his money has gone, and now he wants
more time. Nonsense!”</p>

<p>Capt. Elliott put the document in his pocket
and tried to pray once more, but he couldn’t.
The step he wanted to climb up was so hard, or
rather that paper in his pocket was so weighty!
“A little time,” he kept mumbling to himself.
Gray&ndash;headed old man, chafing because a worried
neighbor begged him not to take his
house, but give him a little time in which to
attempt payment, while he himself was only a
beggar at God’s throne, and had not that
Heavenly Father given him a long time for repentance?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Who was he, thus gripping another
unfortunate by the neck and refusing him the
solicited favor? Get up from your knees,
Capt. Elliott. Stop your praying and go to
writing. Tell Boardman Blake he shall have
his “little time.” Then kneel again and ask
God to have mercy on you, an undeserving old
beggar. As it is, that note in your pocket
clogs your progress, holds you down and holds
you back. You thought you were getting
along rapidly, and had mounted several stairs
and were up quite high. Now you feel bruised
and sore, and down in the depths, as if you had
had a tumble and were lying at the foot of the
stairway again. A bad case indeed.</p>

<p>Ah, God will not take us unless we come to
him whole&ndash;hearted in our desire to serve Him,
and not only ready to give up every sin, but
actually giving it up, letting go old grudges,
willing to do the just and honest and generous
thing by our neighbor. Then He takes us up
in His arms and calls us, “Son, Daughter!”</p>

<p>Another bad case, and that very day too.
The day was not stormy, and yet threatening.
The sea looked cold, and the white crests of
the waves were like patches of snow, pure but
chilling, while between these wintry tufts
were black hollows of water. A mist had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
advanced so far toward the station that the
shore could not be inspected from the lookout
two miles either way. The patrols were on
duty therefore, and Walter was at the Crescent
end of the beach, as that part facing the rocks
in the river was called. Wrapped in his thick,
warm fisher jacket, he faced the keen, chilly
though not violent wind blowing from the
north&ndash;east. Now he made broad footprints in
the gray sand with his big rubber boots, then
he stumbled over rocks matted with the rich
brown of the sea&ndash;weed, or some bold encroachment
of the sea would compel him to withdraw
to the top of a high wall of rock. He was near
the end of his beat, and halted a moment
to watch the play of the waves about the
Chair.</p>

<p>He soon became aware of the presence of
another spectator, somebody looking in the
same direction. It was a man leaning upon
a bulky rock projecting from the sands. As
soon as Walter saw his bending form, the
broad back, the strong shoulders supporting a
round head, and noticed that he was a person of
short stature, he exclaimed, “That’s the man!
That’s the way the man looked whom I saw one
morning in Uncle Boardman’s store, standing
behind the counter as if handling the books on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
those shelves. I have been hunting for him all
this time. Yes, that’s&mdash;” The man here turned
quickly about, and involuntarily Walter added,
and said it aloud, “Baggs!”</p>

<p>“Hum, did you want me?” replied Baggs
rather ungraciously.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Walter confusedly. “Beg your
pardon, Mr. Baggs. Good morning!”</p>

<p>“Well, no, I should think it was a bad morning.
I want to know why you are interrupting
me.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to interrupt you. I am on
my beat, and I only wish to attend to that. I
saw you looking at the Chair, and I was
looking at it myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, can’t a man look at the Chair and
not be interrupted?” replied Baggs, with a
good deal of warmth.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and I can too,” said Walter, who
was not the person to be crowded when in the
discharge of his duties. He felt that he represented
the whole Life Saving Service of the
Atlantic coast, and he was not willing that
Baggs or any one else should do anything that
looked like interference. “I suppose,” added
Walter, “I looked at you rather hard, for you
made me think of a man who mysteriously
appeared and then disappeared in my uncle’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
store one morning.” The next moment, Walter
was saying to himself, “There, I did not intend
to say that. Just like me to let a thing out.”</p>

<p>Walter’s impulsive nature could not easily
retain in concealment anything that interested
him. It was like an arrow on the string of a
drawn bow, and fly it might, any moment.
Baggs was disposed to let fly something also.</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t forgotten that, have
you?” he said testily. “What do you suppose
a man would want in there, at that time? He
couldn’t be stealin’, for I’d like to know what
your uncle has got in there that’s worth stealin’,
or got anywhere as to that matter. No,
sir, I wasn’t the man. My mission is not that
of a thief,” said the pure and lofty Baggs,
striking an attitude designed to be majestic,
but which only made more conspicuous the
awkward proportions of his thick, squat figure.</p>

<p>“If you had let my uncle alone,” exclaimed
Walter very decidedly, “he would have had
something that might have been worth the
envying.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to teach <i>me</i>, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, I am going about my business,” replied
Walter coolly, “for I can’t stay here any longer.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, another time don’t interrupt anybody
looking off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“I am willing any one should look at the
Chair all day, Mr. Baggs. Good day, sir.”</p>

<p>Walter had said, “Well, I’ll treat him
decently anyway,” but his last remark had an
effect that does not generally follow “decent”
remarks. Baggs trembled with excitement,
blustered, almost foamed, and inquired stammeringly,
“Why&mdash;why should I&mdash;look at&mdash;the
Chair? Why&mdash;why&mdash;what have I done&mdash;to
it&mdash;why&mdash;what have I done to the Chair?
You, you’re mistaken, sir, you&mdash;”</p>

<p>Walter turned away in silence and walked
on to the end of his beat. Baggs remained,
muttering to himself as he looked toward the
ill&ndash;omened rocks. When he did leave, he took
the road leading to the village, passed through
The Harbor and then followed the winding
line of the water up to the mill.</p>

<p>“My nephew!” he exclaimed, and stopped
as that brisk vigorous young trader approached.</p>

<p>“Not much trade stirring to&ndash;day,” remarked
Chauncy, rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>“Won’t be in this hole,” replied the uncle
gloomily.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Chauncy encouragingly, “it
will come, it will come. Fact is, the weather
is against us. You can’t force a market
against the weather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>The two had halted near the water. Just
beyond their feet, in a little curve of the shore,
the water suddenly deepened. The boys of the
neighborhood called it the “Pool,” and sometimes
used it as a bathing tub.</p>

<p>“There are too many people that are against
us ever to expect much, Chauncy.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, uncle?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Baggs, dropping his voice and
moving his head nearer to Chauncy’s ear as
if afraid that somebody might hear him, “there
is that Walter Plympton. I think he knows
more than is good for our business. He must
somehow be forced out of the neighborhood.
As I understand it, he will not be at the station
long, but he must not stay here at all. I
will get his old booby uncle to send him home;
and I want you, nephew” (he always said this
when he wished to be affectionate, and sincerely
affectionate he never was), “I want you,
nephew, to say round here and there, you
know, that you&mdash;don’t think he is much of a
feller&mdash;indeed you know of his bein’&mdash;bein’&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Being what, uncle?” asked Chauncy eying
sharply his relative.</p>

<p>“Well, if you don’t just know, get up something.
Well&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Get up what, uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“Well, now, at the ’cademy, wasn’t there
some scrape, wasn’t there drinkin’, wasn’t
there&mdash;”</p>

<p>Chauncy was flippant and conceited and
brassy, and he had veneered certain of his
uncle’s tricks of trade with the name “business
methods,” and had practiced them as the
customary thing among shrewd, enterprising
men, and therefore permissible. Chauncy was
not base enough to spatter with lies the character
of one whom he knew to be trustworthy.
He had rather avoided Walter since the boat&ndash;race,
but he could not deliberately go to work
to ruin his character. Chauncy now mildly demurred;
but at the same time, he lifted his cap
and stroked those formidable locks of hair, and
that meant a pugnacious attitude, a very decided,
“I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe I would, uncle,” said
Chauncy. “I don’t really know anything
against Walter. He’s a sort of a Puritan, and
thinks considerable of Walter Plympton; but
we all of us have a pretty good idea of ourselves.
Guess I wouldn’t,” and he added a
title sometimes used among the great man’s
relatives, “Uncle Bezzie.”</p>

<p>This fond uncle was not in a mood to be contradicted,
and then patted with a soft title. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
turned fiercely on Chauncy, his face swelling
and darkening, his crooked eye flashing, and
his voice roughening.</p>

<p>“What are you&mdash;you&mdash;makin’ opposition for?
Who raised you,&mdash;who&mdash;raised you, sir,&mdash;yes,
raised from&mdash;from obscurity, and gave you a
place in&mdash;in&mdash;a fust class mercantile house?
What&mdash;why&mdash;do you oppose for? You ought
to be ashamed of yourself, sir, yes&mdash;and&mdash;take
that.”</p>

<p>The uncle here lost control of the temper
hidden behind the usually mild voice. He lost
control of himself altogether, for advancing toward
the astonished Chauncy, who was peacefully
but decidedly rubbing his lofty knob of
hair, he suddenly and violently pushed his
beloved nephew over into the water. There
was a fearful agitation, for a few moments,
down in that hitherto peaceful pool; but
Chauncy soon crawled out of the unexpected
bath.</p>

<p>“That’s&mdash;that’s mean!” he ejaculated, spitting
the water from his mouth and shaking it
off from his dripping clothes. Baggs, though,
did not hear him. He was angrily moving
away.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE BARNEY LITERARY CLUB.</p>

<p>Cook Charlie was a blessing. Nature
had made him that handsome present
of a happy temperament, and common
sense had taught him to take good care of the
gift.</p>

<p>“I know my man,” said Keeper Barney when
he hired him. “He’s worth a fortin.”</p>

<p>I have already said that Cook Charlie was
fat. He was also bald. Though not over
thirty, his appearance of age gave a certain
authority to his opinions, and a second title for
him was that of “old man.” Old man or
young man, he was always good&ndash;natured. Did
it blow without? Did the wind bring a sting
with every blast? Cook Charlie was calm.
Did the sky scowl on the tired surfman?
Cook Charlie was sure to smile. Did any discussion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
in the living&ndash;room become a disputation,
ill&ndash;natured, angry, and did the men turn uneasily
in their chairs, stamping stormily on the
floor with their hard, heavy boots? “So&mdash;so,
boys,” Cook Charlie would exclaim. “Now,
look here! Let me put that question.” And
this amiable manipulator of contentious souls
would “put the question” so skillfully that
both sides might find themselves on the same
side! Then Cook Charlie was monarch of the
kitchen stove. He knew that, and what a center
of comfort and happiness he made that
stove! No sulking fire&mdash;one big, black pout&mdash;awaited
the chilled surfman when he came
from his windy beat; but a cheery heat radiated
from that stove, in whose ascending current
the patrolman rubbed and bathed his
hands gratefully. Then the breakfasts, dinners,
and suppers! There was not a great variety
of food, but it was sure to be hot. It was sure
to be abundant also. Then Cook Charlie would
have a little “surprise” for the men, perhaps
a pudding that he would covertly slip out of
the oven and land on the table amid a series
of, “Oh&mdash;Oh&mdash;Oh!” I think he realized that
he had a mission in that bleak little station,
and with his cook stove he could do marvels.
He did not say it in words, but there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
cheerful little tune forever sounding in his
thoughts, and this was the burden of the song:</p>

<p class="ppnq4 p1">“My stove is king,<br />
My stove is king.”</p>

<p class="p1">“Mr. Barney,” said the district superintendent
Baker, one day, “who is your right hand
man here&mdash;I mean the one you get the most
help from?”</p>

<p>“My cook,” said the keeper promptly. “Of
course he wants his wages, but I don’t think
he works just for them. I think he takes a
pleasure in seein’ how well he can do. He
keeps his fire in good condition all the time,
so that the boys can warm themselves handy
any hour; and then, you know, surfmen must
be well fed if you want good work of them. I
call Cook Charlie my steerin’ oar.”</p>

<p>It was Cook Charlie that Walter had a
special talk with one morning. The young
surfman’s watch was now toward sunrise. He
halted as he was about finishing his beat, and
from the doorstep of the station, looked off
upon the sea. Winter was whitening the earth,
but the warm flush of summer was on the sea
and in the sky. It was a holiday sky, a long
fold of purple swathing the horizon. Then
came a pink flush, and deep set in this was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
morning star. The sea was one vast sheet of
silver, warm and placid. Along the shore, it
was wrinkled and broken into surf. Far at the
right, the sky was of a cold azure, and the
sea beneath it was chilled and shadowy also.
Here were two vessels sailing. They seemed
to be eagerly pushing toward that summer
light in the east and that sea of silver.</p>

<p>“I’ll watch the sun come up,” said Walter,
and this sentinel of the Life Saving Service,
his extinguished lantern in his hand, stood
sharply watching as if for an enemy that
would come by water. A noise on the land
called his attention away for a few minutes.
When he turned again, no enemy was there
on that still, shining sea, but away off on the
horizon’s edge was a tiny, pink boat, a boat
without oar or sail, a boat that must have come
for a carnival, but had mistaken the time of
the year. The pink flamed into silver, and the
little boat became a gay turban of some royal
Turk about to show his eyes and peep over
the horizon line at the earth. Was this the
enemy that the young coastguard expected?
No, the turban expanded into a very big innocent&ndash;looking
frozen pudding laid by Neptune’s
jolly cook on this smooth, polished table of the
sea. This confectioner’s dish soon began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
rise, growing into a lofty, bulging dome, a towering
dome, rising, swelling, rounding out&mdash;till
there swung clear of the sea a globe of fire,
the sun himself! He began to assert his presence
in the most unmistakable way, sending
out the sharpest, the most dazzling rays, from
which Walter was glad to turn away his eyes.</p>

<p>“A new day,” said Walter, “and what is
to be done to&ndash;day? Breakfast, and then I may
turn in awhile, and have a nap. The newspaper
will come, and I suppose I shall read
that. We shall have a drill of some kind, and
the watch from the lookout must be kept up.
Then I suppose we shall be loafing about
Charlie’s stove. I believe I have about gone
through that library in the corner. I wish&mdash;yes&mdash;and
I’ll ask Charlie about it right off.”</p>

<p>Cook Charlie was alone with his stove, his
coffee&ndash;pot, and frying&ndash;pan. An appetizing fragrance
welcomed the hungry young surfman as
he opened the door of the station.</p>

<p>“Good chance now,” thought Walter, “and
I’ll speak about it.”</p>

<p>“Charlie,” said Walter, laying down his time&ndash;detector
and signal, and hanging up his lantern,
“I wanted to ask your opinion.”</p>

<p>“Ask away. No charge made.”</p>

<p>“You know time hangs a little heavy here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Walter, but what of it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I was thinking if we couldn’t have a
little variety here. Now there are some subjects
that it would be rather interesting to
know about, it seems to me, and it would be in
our line of business. I mean such as the sea
and storm, or commerce, or our Life Saving Service
and that of England. You know somebody
might write on them, and we have a little society&ndash;meeting
and read our pieces. We could
have a certain afternoon for it, and then we
could discuss subjects. We might call it the
‘Mutual Improvement Society,’ or something
like that, you know.”</p>

<p>“That’s quite an idea, Walter. The name
though might frighten some of ’em out of
doors.”</p>

<p>“Call it&mdash;call it ‘Round the Stove Society.’”</p>

<p>“Ha&ndash;ha, we have that all the time. That’s a
sticker, the name. What shall she be? Well,
I guess we had better get our boat before we
name it. You let me speak to the Cap’n, and
then if he favors it, you say a word to Tom
and Woodbury, and I’ll try the rest.”</p>

<p>Keeper Barney that morning was delayed
by his work, and took his fried potatoes, biscuit
and coffee after the usual breakfast hour.
Cook Charlie thought, “Now is the time. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
are alone, and I’ll bring up that little matter
now. Let me see; how shall I take him? The
Cap’n is a fustrate feller, but he likes to have
the credit of siggestin’, and doin’ things hisself.
I must jest fix it in some way so that he’ll mention
it hisself. Let’s see.”</p>

<p>Fingering his bald head as if he expected to
find the right idea on the outside, if not inside,
he approached the keeper, holding out an additional
plate of “fried taters” just from the
pan, steaming and savory, as an innocent magnet
to bring the keeper’s heart into a favorable
attitude toward the new plan.</p>

<p>“Oh, Charlie, you’re real good,” exclaimed
the keeper.</p>

<p>“You earn it, Cap’n. You have to work hard
enough on somethin’ all the time, fussin’ or
worryin’. I wish the men only had somethin’
to occupy their time.”</p>

<p>“‘Twould be a good idea if they would jest
till up their spare minutes,” remarked the
keeper, as he drank with avidity his coffee.</p>

<p>“A readin’ somethin’, you know; and it
wouldn’t hurt ’em to be a&ndash;studyin’.”</p>

<p>“I know it. I wish our superintendent at
Washington would send us two or three&mdash;four or
five nice new books every winter for our lib’ry.
Congress, of course, must give him the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Why, Cap’n, I’ve let your cup be empty!
Jest let me fill it up smokin’ hot.”</p>

<p>“Charlie, you know jest where a man feels
tender. You ought to run a beach hotel.”</p>

<p>“I am a&ndash;doin’ it now, Cap’n. Ha&ndash;ha! There,
take another biscuit, a hot one. I do wish the
men would be improvin’ their minds. Everybody
can do somethin’. One winter I was at
Duxton, the young people there had a little society,
to write on subjects, you know. Fact is,
people can improve themselves if they want ter.”</p>

<p>The keeper made no reply, not even saying,
“A&ndash;hem!” He continued to eat in silence.
Charlie eyed him sharply.</p>

<p>“Hullo! He’s got an idea! That’s the way
he allers does when an idea strikes him. He
says nothin’ and eats faster and faster, as if an
idea on four legs, its mouth open, was after
him. Hold on!” thought the cook.</p>

<p>Soon came a communication from the silent
eater. He looked up, and then slammed his
hands on the table.</p>

<p>“Charlie, I’ve got an idea! Now what do
you think of it? There’s no sense in the men’s
loafin’ round the stove forever. Let’s get up a
society, a kind of readin’, perhaps speakin’ or
debatin’ society. Call it&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cap’n, you’ve hit the nail on the head. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
cap’tul idee! Call it the Barney Lit’rary Club.
Hoor&ndash;rah!”</p>

<p>And here Cook Charlie in his enthusiasm began
to swing the dish that he held in his hand.
It was half full of crisp brown potatoes, and
they too were unable to resist the excitement of
the hour, and danced off in every direction.</p>

<p>“Oh, Cap’n, there’s the rest of your breakfast!”</p>

<p>“No matter!” said the keeper, a light flashing
from his eyes that made still warmer the
color of his hair, his face and his beard. “No
matter! I’ve had a good breakfast. We’ve
got an idee, you know, to pay for it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Cap’n. You brought down the
right bird that time.”</p>

<p>“You might sound the men on the subject
and tell ’em what I’m a&ndash;thinkin’ of.”</p>

<p>“I will, Cap’n.”</p>

<p>“There’s Walter. He’s handy with his pen.
You tech him up.”</p>

<p>“I will, sure.”</p>

<p>“I must be off now on the beach.”</p>

<p>As he left the room, Cook Charlie went to
the door leading upstairs and called out, “Come
here, Walter. The Cap’n’s proposed jest what
we wanted, and I engaged to speak to you.
Come down! I want to ‘tech’ you up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Details were all arranged, and one afternoon
the “Barney Literary Club” held its first meeting.
It was a wintry day without. The wind
blew sharp and strong from the north&ndash;west, and
meeting the tide that was coming in, broke up
the sea into short, fierce little waves whose
dark, angry blue was spattered with flakes of
white, chilling foam. Across the frozen land
and the dark sea, the brightest of suns looked
smilingly out of a clear sky, but his smiles did
not warm the land or cheer the sea. Did not
all this though, make the living&ndash;room of the station
a snugger, jollier place?</p>

<p>“A grain small,” thought the keeper, “is this
room when we and our big boots all try to get
into it, but we have had some good times here,
and we will have to&ndash;day another.”</p>

<p>The keeper, as president, sat in the chair of
honor, and that was an ordinary chair placed
against the wall between the boat&ndash;room door
and the outer door. At his right sat Cook
Charlie, the secretary, awkwardly fumbling a
lead pencil and sheet of paper. Walter was on
the left of the president. An eager yet embarrassed
look was on his face, for he had been appointed
to read a paper which he nervously
clutched with both hands. The other members
of the crew were scattered about the room, all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
them permanently located except Slim Tarleton.
It was his watch, and every few minutes he
would run up the stairs and from the lookout
sweep with his glass the sea, that subtle, treacherous
power which must be watched, day and
night. The president made a very short speech
to the “Barney Literary Club,” and then read a
paper on the United States Life Saving Service.
The facts given are embodied already in this
book.</p>

<p>“I will now call on Walter for a paper,” said
the president.</p>

<p>There was a tickle that needed to be expelled
from Walter’s throat, and at the same time a
warm blush spread up to the roots of his hair.</p>

<p>“My paper is on the Life Saving Service of
other countries. Great Britain, which has a
coast almost five thousand miles long, has a
Royal National Life&ndash;boat Institution. It is supported
by voluntary offerings. Its object is to
provide and maintain life&ndash;boats, and it also rewards
efforts to save the shipwrecked at points
where it may have no station. A life&ndash;boat with
all necessary equipments, and that would include
carriage, will cost somewhat over three
thousand dollars, and a boathouse can be built
for about seventeen hundred. The cost of keeping
up a station is about three hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
fifty dollars for the year, a sum that would support
an American station with seven men for
only one month. In England, the above sum
pays the crew for going off to any wrecks,
for exercising their boat once every three
months, and covers also the coxswain’s salary
and any repairs. The life&ndash;boats are of different
sizes&mdash;six, eight, ten and twelve&ndash;oared. Some
of the crews go out but seldom. When it
is rough thereabouts at the Goodwin Sands, the
life&ndash;boat men must stand watch all the time.
At Ramsgate, the service is so important that
a steamer waits on the boat constantly, its
fires banked up ready for any emergency. Different
cities like Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow
and others, have given life&ndash;boats to the Institution,
and contribute every year to its funds.</p>

<p>“England’s work though for the shipwrecked
takes in something else besides the work of the
life&ndash;boats. There is the Rocket Service. The
thirtieth of June, 1881, there were two hundred
and eighty&ndash;eight rocket stations. The rocket
apparatus consists of the rocket, the rocket line,
the whip, the hawser, and sling life&ndash;buoy. The
rocket has a line, a light one, fastened to it,
which is shot over a wreck. Then the rest of
the apparatus is used. We use the gun or mortar
instead of the rocket. England’s rocket stations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
are under the control of the Board of
Trade. The men of the coastguard manage the
rockets. For every life saved, the Board of
Trade pays a sum of money. It gives medals
also to those who may have shown unusual
courage. The wants of sailors and others who
may be saved from shipwreck are now met by
the ‘Shipwrecked Fishermen and Mariners’
Royal Benevolent Society.’ The work, then,
that we do in our stations, in England seems
to be spread out, and it is done by several
bodies, and how much the whole may cost, I
can’t say. Of course, it is not fair to compare
the money expended in England with the
amount we spend, until we know all the expenses
there. I think, though, our system is
better than England’s.</p>

<p>“There is a ‘French Society for Saving Life
from Shipwreck.’ It was started in 1865, and
not only along the coast of France, but in Algeria
and other colonies, has this society carried on
its work. In sixteen years, it saved two thousand
and one hundred and twenty&ndash;nine lives. June
30th, 1881, it had sixty&ndash;two life&ndash;boat stations,
and three hundred and ninety&ndash;one mortar or
other projectile stations. It is modeled after
the English system, but it prefers the gun to
the rocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is the ‘German Association for the
Rescue of Life from Shipwreck,’ founded in
1865. It is supported by donations. The last
report I saw, gave it seventy&ndash;four life&ndash;boat stations,
twenty of these having the mortar or
rocket apparatus. There must be a larger number
now. In 1880&ndash;81, it saved two ships and
a hundred and twenty&ndash;two lives; and from May,
1880, to May, 1881, its members subscribed
over a quarter of a million of dollars. Germany
has flat sandy beaches, and it cannot
so well use England’s heavy boats. It is said
that in Russia, Italy and Spain, life saving
societies patterned more or less after England’s
‘National Life&ndash;boat Institution,’ have been organized.
England must have a magnificent
navy of life&ndash;boats and a fine rocket service; but
I guess Uncle Sam with his hands in his deep
pockets, paying out more and more every year,
has organized a service that can’t be matched
elsewhere. That is my opinion, and I would
like to ask the company’s.”</p>

<p>This patriotic appeal to the company was exceedingly
popular. Boots went down heavily,
hands came together sharply, and enthusiastic
cries of “Good!” “Good!” were heard all
over the room. Then the secretary read a
humorous paper on “The Surfman&mdash;his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Stormy Patrol,” giving experiences he had
gleaned from the crew, and so faithfully reported
that they were readily recognized, winning
him a round of hand&ndash;claps.</p>

<p>“Woodbury!” “Woodbury!” was now
heard from several quarters. “That Sea&ndash;Sarpent!
Let us have it!” “Don’t be bashful!”</p>

<p>Woodbury Elliott was nervously twisting in
his chair, the color deepening in his fair complexion,
saying, “No! No! I couldn’t!” But
the Literary Club had all attended school with
him, save Walter and Joe Cardridge (a bad
specimen of imported humanity) and they knew
what Woodbury could do at “speakin’ pieces.”</p>

<p>That famous character, the sea&ndash;serpent, he
had made still more famous by his successful
delivery, at school, of a comical criticism upon
the animal, and in after days, it would often be
called for, and was always sure of an admiring
audience.</p>

<p>“Well, here goes!” said the surfman, and
Woodbury Elliott rose to give once more this
marine gem. The laughter following it was
hearty as ever, but it had not wholly died
away when an unexpected orator, Joe Cardridge,
volunteered to entertain the Literary Club.</p>

<p>“Boys, you did not know I was a speaker.
Well, I was some, once,” he asserted in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
conceited way, “and if you’d like, I’ll give you
the ‘Auctioneer.’”</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer from the club,
he called out to Cook Charlie, “Where is that
butter firkin I saw round here? I want it to
stand on.”</p>

<p>“A leetle ticklish, Joe. I wouldn’t resk it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s good enough. An auctioneer must
be up ’bove his crowd, you know. Fun for ye
now, boys, I tell ye. I was always great on it,
and I guess I’m good for it now. Where’s
that firkin?”</p>

<p>The firkin was brought, turned upside down,
and Joe mounted it. He had forgotten a part
of his speech, but it made no difference in his
enjoyment of his fancied brilliant success. He
gesticulated, jumped up and down, endeavored
to work up into buying mood his audience
with frequent threats like this, “Goin’, goin’,
genlummum!” The bottom of a butter firkin
can stand what is reasonable, but what self&ndash;respecting
firkin will submit to everything?
Joe’s would not. In the midst of several infuriated
shrieks. “Goin’, goin’, genlummum,”
his audience looking on with a silent but manifest
sneer, several heard a suspicious “cr&mdash;cr&mdash;ack!”
Joe in his intense admiration of the
performer did not hear it. He gave another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
jump, the word “gone” issuing from his throat,
when the firkin emphasized this threat by
suddenly withdrawing its bottom, and “gone”
it was for the auctioneer! Down he came,
partly in the firkin and partly outside of it, falling
in a very mixed condition. The club
roared. Any merriment was now sincere. The
president forgot all his dignity and joined in
the laugh. The secretary was always ready
for any fun. As for Joe, he was mad. He declared
that he had been insulted. “Fool!” he
shouted at Walter. “What you larfin’ at?”
Leering at the company in his rage and mortification,
he rushed out of doors.</p>

<p>“Guess he’ll cool off there,” observed the
president. “We will have the next exercise.”</p>

<p>This was the “Opening of the Drawer.”
Any one was at liberty to drop into an imaginary
drawer any question about the papers.
He could ask it orally, or write it on a slip of
paper. The club would then attempt to answer
the question.</p>

<p>After a session of two hours, this company of
literati broke up. It resolved itself into a station&ndash;crew
again. Distinguished orators and
able writers changed into hungry surfmen
around a supper table where huge cups of coffee
sent up little clouds of fragrant steam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
There was a further change into patrolmen in
thick Scotch caps, and Guernsey jackets and
heavy, stamping boots, into watchers for the
night coming and going. At last the unemployed
members of the Literary Club were all
soundly snoring under thick army blankets,
the little kitchen was deserted, save by the
keeper, and the stove made but a faint little
murmur by the side of that great black ocean
thundering on the rocks and roaring all
through the cold, black night.</p>

<p>The Advent days had now come, when
the winds blow keen across the frozen
ground, and nature seems to be in a
violent grief over sins it had hoped to bury in
frosty graves forever, but which will not quietly
lie there. “Beyond Advent though is Christmas,”
thought Walter, “and I shall spend it

<p>Walter’s time at the station had almost expired.
He could not say that he was tired of
the service, and yet he noticed something in
the attitude of the men which made him a little
discontented. What it was, he could not
definitely say, but there was some coolness on
their part. Tom Walker and Woodbury Elliott
were exceptions to any change by way
of coolness, and yet was there not a noticeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
warmth of treatment on their part? It had
an element of pity, and as Joe Cardridge froze
into a cold, contemptuous silence toward Walter,
as others coolly noticed him, Tom and
Woodbury were more cordial. When the wind,
wintry and sharp, cuts into a party of men out
doors, they may protect themselves against it
by a fire. Does the wind blow more and more
chilly? Then they pile the wood higher and
higher. So Tom and Woodbury made friendship’s
fire burn all the warmer, because an outside
atmosphere was growing colder.</p>

<p>What did it all mean? Walter could not see
to the bottom of this mystery. What had he
done, why one man should shrink from him, and
at the same time another man grow so much
more friendly?</p>

<p>In addition to all this, came a very significant
look from the keeper, one afternoon, as he
and Walter chanced to be alone, and after the
look, came a significant question. It was one
of those sharp looks where one seems to have
a gimlet in his eyes, and he bores deep into the
person he confronts. Such a look as that of the
detective meeting a criminal.</p>

<p>“Walter&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;hope I am on the wrong
track altogether&mdash;but there are some stories
round about you which I think you ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
know, and as keeper I think I ought to look
into ’em. We have to be particular here, but
you know that, of course&mdash;and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it, Cap’n Barney? Don’t keep
a fellow roasting in an oven longer than is necessary.
I am ready to answer any charges.”</p>

<p>Walter’s eyes were flashing, and as he
straightened up in his indignation, it seemed
as if he had grown six inches taller during the
short speech the keeper had made.</p>

<p>“I have been suspecting that something was
out of the way, because some of the men have
cooled off so, and I’d like to get hold of the
trouble well as you, Cap’n Barney. I’ll pull
that rat out of his hole, if I can catch hold of his
tail.”</p>

<p>The keeper smiled. He admired the young
man’s spirit of ready, honest indignation, and
Walter s figure of speech amused him.</p>

<p>“Wall, Walter, I don’t say the stories are
true, and I have said that no man is to be held
guilty until proved to be, and if you deny them,
that <i>ends</i> ’em for me.”</p>

<p>He emphasized his remarks and put a period
to them by bringing a huge, brown fist down
on the long kitchen table, making the Coston
signals and time&ndash;detectors there rattle away.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, name the charges, for it is getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
awful warm here,” said Walter, in his impatience
to know the charges, which he felt was to
know several lies.</p>

<p>“Wall, they say at the ’cademy where you
were, that you were up to scrapes, a&ndash;drinkin’
and carousin’, and that you have been drinkin’
here, even while at the station.”</p>

<p>“It is a lie, one big Atlantic lie, big as that
ocean out there!”</p>

<p>“There, I told ye so!” said a voice triumphantly.
“I knew it was just so! Good for
you, Walter! S’cuse me, Cap’n, but I happened
to come in just then and couldn’t help
a&ndash;hearin’ ye.”</p>

<p>It was Tom Walker who had suddenly entered,
his bushy beard whitened by the snow&ndash;flakes
dropping without.</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t mentioned it, Cap’n, I was
goin’ to, this very day. I thought it was dickerlus
and didn’t b’lieve it was worth noticin’
at fust; but it’s got so at last, I should have
spoken of it if you hadn’t, and Woodbury
would if I hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Cap’n, every word of it!” and now
behind Tom, appeared Woodbury at the door,
brushing the snow off from his coat. “That’s
so,” he continued, and he looked at Walter not
at all in the gimlet fashion, but a friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
smile of recognition lightened up his handsome
face.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are of my mind, boys,” said the
keeper. “I knew Walter wouldn’t do that
thing. It is not his style at all.”</p>

<p>“Now, Cap’n, I want to know who has been
accusing me,” said Walter. “This thing must
be looked into.”</p>

<p>“That is only fair. Several have mentioned
it, but Joe Cardridge seems to be the special
one.”</p>

<p>“Joe Cardridge! Where is he?” asked
Walter looking at the boat&ndash;room door, the
outer door, the door leading upstairs to the
crew’s room. “Where is he? I’ll get him and
bring him here and face the charges here.”</p>

<p>He was starting off, trying to go in several
directions at once, when the keeper said,
“Hold on, Walter. It is Joe’s day off. He is
not within a mile of this place now, but he will
be back I s’pose in time to go on his beat. This
thing shall be looked into.”</p>

<p>“I insist upon it that it shall,” said Walter.</p>

<p>The weather outside was not at all attractive
to the patrolmen that day, and when the twilight
drew its dusky curtains about the station,
the outlook was still bad. A north&ndash;west wind
was blowing very strong and cutting. Snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
was still falling in light, dry flakes. What was
already on the ground served as a plaything
to the wind that seemed to be intelligently and
maliciously gathering it up and then hurling
it into the faces of all travelers, flinging it over
their heads in blinding, cutting sheets, withdrawing
these until its victim walked in an
easy, careless confidence, then sending the snow
again in sheets more closely folding and stifling
and cutting.</p>

<p>“You’d better wrap up specially warm,” was
Tom Walker’s reminder to Walter, who went
on to his beat at night.</p>

<p>“I will, thank you. I will put on that new
blue flannel blouse for one thing.”</p>

<p>“I would, Walter. I find that mine comes
in awful handy. You see it is padded thick
and warm. Six of us, I believe, bought them.”</p>

<p>These six new flannel blouses were bought
from a traveling clothing&ndash;peddler who came to
the station and with a glib tongue so skillfully
paraded the advantages of a purchase,
that almost all the men accepted this rare
opportunity.</p>

<p>“Well, Walter, you might have done wuss,”
said Aunt Lydia, one day when Walter chanced
to call upon her, and laying it on her sewing
basket asked her to examine the blouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“You paid all it’s worth, but it does seem
thick and warm, and I guess it will do you
service. I will take a few stitches in it for you
where a needle is wanted.”</p>

<p>“A pretty good looking set of surfmen when
we get our new blouses on, neat and clean, you
know, and then turn out for some drill at the
station. The only trouble is that the coats
look so much alike and are of about the same
size.”</p>

<p>“Look alike!” thought Aunt Lydia. “Guess
I will tuck a blue ‘W’ on somewhere.”</p>

<p>With her nimble needle, she “tucked” this
blue initial inside one of the sleeves just above
the wrist. The blouse lining was white. Without
any reference to this, she handed Walter’s
blouse back to him.</p>

<p>He wore this blouse, that night of the wind
and snow.</p>

<p>“Glad I have got it,” he said, pushing out
into the night. “It helps keep a fellow warm.
Now for it!”</p>

<p>He crossed from the station lot to the beach,
and was glad to find a strip of sand that the
rising tide had not yet covered. “Boom&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;m!”
went the waves in one unending roar.
The wind was drowned in that chorus, and as
it blew from the north&ndash;west and drove at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
back, Walter cared little for its fury. When
the tide forced him to walk upon the rocks,
though their surface was so uneven and so slippery
with the snow, he made steady progress
and completed his beat in about the usual time,
He turned to begin his homeward walk, and
then the wind pounced upon him with all its
fury.</p>

<p>“Now I have you!” it seemed to say. “I
can drive into your face, blind your eyes with
snow&mdash;there, take that!” A flurry of flakes
came into his face, sharp, tingling, compelling
him to turn and offer his back to the charge.</p>

<p>“I can go this way,” thought Walter.
“Hard work though! What if I should see
any trouble on the water and have to signal
and start for the station?”</p>

<p>No sign of trouble did the young patrolman
discover, no flash from any rocket. There was
only one huge, roaring blackness! He stubbornly
fought his way over the rocks, across
any chance bit of sand, now splashing through
the pools left in the ledges by the tide, struggling
over an ice bank to high ground where
a field skirted the shore and along whose
edge he could walk and still have before him
that ocean which he must continually watch
and ever be prepared to fight. He was not far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
from the station, and was saying, “Well, I have
whipped the wind this time,” when he remembered
that he still had an ugly place to cross.
It was an abrupt break in a shore ledge, and
could be avoided by keeping to the right and
taking the ground in the rear of the ledge.
By making this detour, though, he lost sight
of the sea, and in that interval, what if some
vessel sent up from the water its plea for help&mdash;a
vain appeal because no vigilant patrol detected
the rocket’s flight?</p>

<p>“I must go down into that hole and keep my
eyes on the ocean,” thought Walter, and guided
by his lantern, he was stepping down the rough
declivity in the rock, when the wind as if fearful
that it might for a single instant, in some
sheltered nook, lose its opportunity to make
trouble, blew with frantic fury. In the midst
of this fiendish blast, Walter’s light was blown
out!</p>

<p>“She’s gone!” he was saying one moment,
and the next, he was conscious that he was
making a misstep and was tumbling! Then
came a blank, as if the wind extinguishing his
lantern, had extinguished him also, and down
into a black hole he had fallen. There was an
interval of unconsciousness black as the sea
beyond him. Finally he was aware that somebody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
was calling to him. A light also was
trying to reach him as he lay at the bottom of
this deep, black pit. The light flashed into his
eyes, sharpened and expanded, and the voice
too sounded louder and louder. At last, the
voice said, “Hullo, boy, what ye up to down
here?”</p>

<p>“Joe Cardridge!” thought Walter.</p>

<p>“Come, git up! Lemme help ye!”</p>

<p>“What have you been saying about me?”
was Walter’s first thought. Then he reflected:
“Well, this is hardly the time to bring the
matter up when a man is saving you from a fall.”</p>

<p>“Jest lean on me. You had an ugly tumble,”
said Joe.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess I can get up, thank you.”</p>

<p>“There’s blood on your face. You must
have hit yourself when you struck.” Then
Joe’s tone changed. “That comes from havin’
surf&ndash;boys round,” he muttered with a sneer.
“Ought to be home with their mothers.”</p>

<p>“What did you say?” asked Walter, catching
the words with difficulty in his confused state
of mind. “I’m obliged to you for finding me,
but I can walk myself. Surf&ndash;boys are good for
something,” he added with pride.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be techy. Come along.”</p>

<p>“You can go ahead,” said Walter with dignity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
“and I will follow.” Joe made another
mutter, but it was unintelligible this time, and
Walter made no reply.</p>

<p>“I have had a bad tumble and did not know
anything for some time,” said Walter, as he entered
the station and found Cook Charlie in a
chair by the stove.</p>

<p>“Poor feller!” exclaimed the cook sympathetically.
“Sit down here, and I’ll have you
some coffee less than no time. What&mdash;blood
on ye? Here, let me wipe it off.”</p>

<p>“Not serious, I guess.”</p>

<p>“No, only a hard rub. I’ll fix it.”</p>

<p>Charlie insisted on caring for Walter, but the
latter said he must care for himself. Cook Charlie’s
sympathy though, was pleasant. Something
else was agreeable; Walter’s mortification and
bruises were all finally drowned in the depth of
that sea never cruel but always kind&mdash;sleep.</p>

<p>Keeper Barney was walking the next morning
through the crew’s sleeping quarters when
he heard a stealthy step behind him. With
the sound of the steps came the sound of a
voice, “Cap’n.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that you, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Cap’n. May I have a word with
you?” asked Joe Cardridge.</p>

<p>“Sartin. Say on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as it is any of my business,
but it is some of your’n. You know there have
been stories round about that boy, Walter&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, Joe, and I don’t believe them. I told
him about them, and he wanted to know who
said so, and I had to give your name. He is
dreadful anxious to see you, and if you have
any proof, I advise you to be ready to bring
it on.”</p>

<p>“Proof!” said Joe sneeringly, flashing a
spark of hate out of his usually dull, sleepy
black eyes. “What was last night but proof?”</p>

<p>“Last night? Why, it was an awful tough
night, and the feller stumbled. Did you never
fall? Cook Charlie said it was done in the discharge
of duty, so he gethered, that Walter
might have avoided the place, but if he had,
he would have lost sight of the ocean, and not
bein’ so well used to the place as some of the
rest of us, he did not succeed in keepin’ his
footin’.”</p>

<p>“Keepin’ his footin’!” was Joe’s contemptuous
reply. “Look here! What would you
say if I told you the boy was under the influence
of liquor when I found him. I s’pose he
took suthin’&mdash;it bein’ a cold night&mdash;and he took
too much; but you don’t want the men to do
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Neither too much nor too little. I don’t
want them to touch it at all. There is plenty of
hot coffee. That will brace ’em up and warm
’em up. Do you mean to say that you have
positive proof that Walter had been a&ndash;foolin’
with drink?”</p>

<p>“He acted jest like it.”</p>

<p>“But he was hurt, and very nat’rally was
confused.”</p>

<p>“S’posin’ I should say I saw a bottle stickin’
out of his pockets, when he was undressin’?”</p>

<p>“You did?”</p>

<p>“May be there now, for all I know,” said
Joe carelessly.</p>

<p>“Nonsense. I don’t believe it. You are altogether
too suspicious, and I can prove it now.”</p>

<p>Here the keeper walked to the opposite side
of the room, and turning to the clothes that
swung from a row of pegs above Walter’s chest,
began to pull them over. Suddenly he drew
back his hand as if it had touched a red&ndash;hot
coal! In one of the pockets in Walter’s blue
blouse, was a brandy&ndash;flask!</p>

<p>“Indeed!” exclaimed the keeper.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell ye so? That’s what I saw in
Walter’s pocket last night, and I smelt his
breath. You goin’ to keep such a boy as that
round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>Here Joe looked up into the keeper’s face
somewhat as a snake might be supposed to eye
the object he had struck and vanquished.</p>

<p>“Wall&mdash;I must look into this. Let everything
stay jest as it is. I must go into my room
a few minutes. Soon as Walter comes into the
station, I’ll have him up here, and I want you
to be round too.”</p>

<p>“I’m ready any time, Cap’n. I’m down on
pickerprites. Only next time, Cap’n, be willin’
to take my word quick as you do Walter’s.”</p>

<p>Keeper Barney did not hear the last sentence.
He hurried away to his room, glad to close the
door and hide his manifest disappointment. His
position was one that bringing responsibility,
carried anxiety with it also. There were many
details in his work sometimes perplexing and
always burdening. He expected this. He was
prepared to find among the men in his crew the
average amount of laziness and eye&ndash;service,
of ill&ndash;temper and jealousy. He was not surprised
if some men proved to be treacherous,
and after seeing Joe Cardridge’s face once, he
expected to find many bad places in the fabric
of his character. Walter Plympton, he did
thoroughly trust, and he was heartsick at the
evidence that he was untrustworthy.</p>

<p>“I did not expect to git that blow,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
keeper. “However, I’ll see what Walter has
to say ’fore finally condemnin’ him. The evidence
though looks bad. The sooner I go
through this thing, the better. Walter will be
in pretty quick, I guess.”</p>

<p>He appeared sooner than he was expected. Joe
Cardridge’s boots had hardly ceased to pound
their way downstairs before another pair began
to pound their way up, and somebody rapped
on the keeper’s door.</p>

<p>“Come in!” was Keeper Barney’s response.
The door opened and Walter entered.</p>

<p>“Joe Cardridge said you wanted to see me
and I told him I wanted to see him and you
together. He has not come though. And then,
sir, I had a letter for you. I brought it with
me from the office last evening, but you were
not here when I came, and Cook Charlie thought
it would do to give it to you this morning
rather than disturb you, as you were not feeling
just right. It is in my blouse hanging up,
and I will get it now.”</p>

<p>Walter fumbled in his pockets for the letter,
but his blouse refused to yield any such document.
Indeed, it had none to yield.</p>

<p>“Why, why, I can’t find it!” stammered
Walter.</p>

<p>“What letter?” asked the keeper sternly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
He had followed Walter into the crew’s room,
and was eying him sharply.</p>

<p>“It was a letter from the district superintendent,&mdash;judging
from the envelope&mdash;and I supposed
I had it sure, but I can’t find it where I
put it. Let me hunt all through my blouse,
look in every pocket. What’s&mdash;this? Why!”</p>

<p>The keeper eyed Walter still more sharply
and curiously, watching him with a smile of
wonder to see what Walter would do when he
reached the pocket where the brandy flask was.
A guilty person would have attempted to hide
it, but in a natural way Walter pulled it out,
held it up, and manifested his surprise.</p>

<p>“Is that the letter the superintendent sent?”
inquired the keeper sarcastically. “If it is, he
has changed his principles a good deal.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t mine. I don’t know anything
about it, Cap’n Barney.”</p>

<p>“Look here! Hasn’t this thing gone far
enough, Walter? Here you arrive at the station
in a s’picious condition when your patrol
is up, one of the surfmen picking you up, and
a brandy flask is found in your pocket. A letter
too is missing, a letter from the deestrick
superintendent, who will make us a visit in five
days, and I s’pose it is a special matter he
wants me to look into. It puts me in a pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
fix. You&mdash;you&mdash;you.” The keeper was stumbling
about in his effort to find the word he
wished to use. He was angry at the loss of the
letter, knowing that it might contain directions
whose neglect would seriously damage him
in the opinion of his superior. While he was
irritated by a sense of his loss, Walter was indignant
at the thought that he could be supposed
to carry a brandy flask with him for
tippling purposes. His bright hazel eyes were
full of fire&ndash;flashes, and he threw back his handsome
head in the pride of innocence.</p>

<p>“Cap’n Barney,” he asserted, “I am very
sorry that letter can’t be found. I think it will
be found, but if it should not turn up to&ndash;day
I will write to the superintendent and tell him
frankly of all that happened, of my misfortune
last night, and ask him to write to you, saying
that I am sorry for troubling him, and as for
the other matter&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said a voice breaking in suddenly,
“that’s fair enough.” It was Cook Charlie’s
voice. He had come upstairs, unobserved by
the keeper and Walter. “You see, Cap’n,”
he continued, and in that tone of voice which
was peculiar to Charlie and was like “oil
on troubled waters,” “I am part to blame
’bout this letter business. Walter had it last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
night, and wanted to hand it over then, but
I told him jest to hold on to it, that the
mornin’ would do. Of course, you work hard,
and you were sick&mdash;and everybody knows you
have enough on your mind to make a hoss sick,
and there isn’t a more faithfuler keeper on the
coast&mdash;and of course, I did not want to disturb
ye. Blame me as well as Walter. Oh, it will
turn up! Besides, he has offered to do the
fair thing in writing to the superintendent, and
that relieves a faithful keeper like you, and
nobody could do more.”</p>

<p>Under the skillful stroking of Cook Charlie’s
words of praise, Keeper Barney’s agitation
rapidly subsided, and the hard, angry lines in
his face began to fade away.</p>

<p>Walter now spoke; “As for that brandy flask,
I have no idea how it came in my pocket. It
is my coat, I allow, but I don’t own what’s in
that pocket. There is some mistake here, and
it was put in accidentally or somebody is trying
to harm me. You can dismiss me if you
want to, but I want the superintendent to investigate
this whole matter, and if you will
wait until he comes&mdash;no, turn me off now if
you think it fair when I have had no chance
to turn round, you might say, and speak for
myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“It is Joe Cardridge who says you were not
jest right when he found you last night.”</p>

<p>“Does <i>he</i> say that I had been a&ndash;drinking?
Then it’s a lie. Let me see him! Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Quiet, Walter! You have got friends.”
This was a new voice, Woodbury Elliott’s.</p>

<p>By this time, all the crew were upstairs.
The loud talking had attracted one curious head
above the railing that guarded the stairs running
up from the kitchen, then another head,
then a third, till finally they all had stolen up
stealthily, for no matter what etiquette might
have demanded, the curiosity of human nature
inherited from Eve (and Adam also) was a
stronger motive, and there they were in a
rough circle about the keeper and Walter.</p>

<p>“Quiet!” said Woodbury softly to Walter
again. “Cap’n Barney, let me say a word why I
think you should let this thing hang over until
the superintendent’s visit, that is supposin’
you had made up your mind to discharge Walter.”
He then proceeded to review the whole
case, beginning with the slanderous stories whispered
about Walter, and closing with a reference
to the mysterious discovery of the flask
in Walter’s pocket. Against everything that
looked suspicious, he put Walter’s previous
good character and excellent record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cap’n Barney, has a man of us given you so
little trouble in his conduct in the station?
Has a man been more prompt to mind you,
been more pleasant among the crew?”</p>

<p>As Woodbury went on, pleading with animation,
it was plain that in the opinion of the
crew, he was fully sustaining his reputation as
the best school orator in the “deestrict.” There
were little chuckles of admiration heard now
and then, and the keeper himself nodded his
assent to Woodbury’s points.</p>

<p>He had hardly finished his plea, when an
eager voice on the outer rim of the circle
squeaked, “Lem <i>me</i> speak! Guess I can speak
some,” said Joe Cardridge, hastily moving forward.
“I have a few p’ints to make. I was
the one who found Walter, and know more’n
any one else. I’ve told ye how I found him,
and you know what you yourself found in his
blouse! And what do the reggerlations say?”</p>

<p>He now began to quote from a regulation
that says, “Keepers are forbidden to keep or
sell, or allow to be kept or sold on the station
premises, any intoxicating liquors; nor
will they permit any person under the influence
of intoxicating drinks to enter the station
house or remain upon the premises.”</p>

<p>With all the impressiveness of a jury orator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
gesticulating furiously, amid the undisguised
impatience of his auditors, he continued to quote:
“Keepers will&mdash;will&mdash;not permit any&mdash;pusson&mdash;under
the&mdash;influen&mdash;en&mdash;za&mdash;of intoxicatin’&mdash;drinks&mdash;drinks&mdash;er&mdash;er.”</p>

<p>“Er&mdash;Er!” said some one in the ring of listeners,
and all began to laugh. Joe was raving.
He declared that he would not stay to
be insulted, that Walter was clearly proved
guilty. He was careful to say nothing disrespectful
to the keeper, but he did not hesitate
to pay his compliments to the crew in
very stalwart Saxon. He then went downstairs,
stamping and raving about “Surf&ndash;boys.”
He would have returned, but the keeper stopped
him. “I shall do my duty,” coolly declared
the keeper, “and I shall expect you, Joe Cardridge,
to do yours. As for Walter’s case, it
shall lie over until the arrival of the superintendent.
If you can explain things, Walter,
I shall be glad to have you. I don’t think any
of you will blame me for not dismissing the
case at once when you remember how strictly
I shall be held to account, and how dangerous
in our work all tamperin’ with liquor may be.
Cool heads and steady nerves, we must have.”</p>

<p>“I believe that, Cap’n Barney,” said Walter,
“and I will help you maintain discipline. I only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
want a chance to turn around and defend myself;
for somebody is striking at me in the dark,
and I don’t know where to strike back. It is a
cowardly game they are playing. False, every
bit of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” grunted that faithful supporter,
Tom Walker.</p>

<p>“Only give me a chance, sir,” insisted Walter.</p>

<p>“You are goin’ to have it.”</p>

<p>When the crew separated, Slim Tarleton patted
Woodbury on the shoulder and said, “You
did well, Wood; you did well. ’Twas good as
the ‘Sea Sarpint.’”</p>

<p>The favorite orator of The Harbor was gratified
to win this praise, and he went away happy.
With what feelings though did Walter separate
from his mates? Buttoning his coat closely
about him, into the wintry air out he stepped,
anxious to seclude himself a while. He
went to a nook in the rocks overshadowing the
dismal, unfortunate hole into which he fell only
the night before. The storm was over. The
clouds were breaking up, and the hard, pitiless
blue sky was disclosing itself in irregular patches.
The tone of the coloring of the sea was also
that of a hard, pitiless blue, dashed here and
there with chilling foam&ndash;streaks. Against a
land white and frozen, the surf continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
swept like one snow&ndash;drift rolling up against
another. Walter sat down in his rocky corner
and looked off upon the sea. It was not pleasant
to be suspected, and suspected wrongfully. It
was true that he had the sympathy of most of
the crew, and the keeper wished to find him
innocent, but Keeper Barney showed that he
was distrustful. Walter’s time at the station
was almost up. In a week, Silas Fay, for whom
Walter had been serving as substitute, expected
to be in his old place, and Walter wished to
leave with credit, not under this horrible cloud
of suspicion. He was going back to Uncle
Boardman’s. He would meet The Harbor people
and May Elliott. He would soon visit those at
home. It was not an agreeable thought that he
would go as one accused even if not proved
guilty. He felt that these accusations set him
apart, isolated him, and others were looking at
him as one suspected. There was a great, crushing
loneliness that bore upon him,&mdash;only for a
moment though. While he was watching the
sea and the eastern sky, the sun suddenly broke
through the clouds, and a flood of light swept
everywhere, far out to sea, far along the shore,
warming the wave&ndash;crests, the surf, the snow&ndash;banks.
And with this burst of light, flashed
into Walter’s soul the thought of God, filling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and glorifying all space without, all the soul
within. It was God who knew him, understood
him, believed him, would befriend him; and
Walter was no longer alone. That revelation
of God made in this trying hour was a new,
unanticipated, rich experience. It came when
he was hard pressed and driven in upon himself,
so weak, helpless and alone, only to find
that God had not failed him and was with him
all the time. God will not fail any trusting
child. He will stand by you. Walter felt
strong. He rose from his seat in the rocks and
stood erect as if shaking off a hard, heavy
burden. The tears were in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I did not think God was so near,” he
murmured. In his religious life, he had been
trying to follow God, not with all the success
he craved, and yet still trying to follow Him.
And now in this hour of trial, of attack by enemies,
that great Leader had come to him and
strengthened him. Is He not always near?
There is dimness of sight in us, and not a lack
of nearness on God’s part.</p>

<p>“I will try to keep close to God,” thought
Walter.</p>

<p>There came to him also that consciousness of
nature’s approbation, which he had experienced
once before. The sky, the sun, the sea, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
seemed to assure him that he was right and that
they were in league with him. That sea,
though&mdash;could it be trusted? Might it not prove
treacherous, those chilling hidden depths under
all the sunlight now flashing across the waves?</p>

<p>“Five days in which to show I am innocent,”
said Walter. “Who knows what may happen
in five days?”</p>

<p>Yes, who could tell?</p>

<p>He turned from the sea and walked back to
the station.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="pch">A SOUL IN NEED.</p>

<p>Two days after Walter’s fall in the night,
he had leave of absence extending
from sunrise to sunset. He did not
care to take it, his time at the station was so
brief, and especially as he was anxious to
prove his purpose to be loyal to all obligations
resting upon him.</p>

<p>“It is your turn to be off, Walter,” said the
keeper. “You are fairly entitled to it, and I
want you to have what is yours. Be on hand
at sunset. You may learn something in your
favor, and you had better improve your chance.”</p>

<p>With the keeper’s apparent kindness went an
insinuation that Walter’s course had not entirely
been swept clean of every shadow of suspicion,
and if he could find a broom to do this
sweeping, it was plainly suggested that he had
better secure it. That remark decided Walter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
in his course. He left the station in no pleasant
mood of mind, and the keeper’s words had
occasioned it. “If I can, I will get that help,”
thought Walter, walking off rapidly, “but&mdash;where?”</p>

<p>He was puzzled. One memory came to him,
however. It was what his father said once:
“Walter, if things go wrong, if people say we
are wrong and yet we know we are right, but
can’t somehow show it and prove it, then wait
and let God do the proving. He is as much
interested in good character as we, more so even,
and He will bring things round right. Tie up
to that post.”</p>

<p>“I will tie up to that post,” declared Walter.</p>

<p>He did not go directly to his uncle’s, but took
the road to The Harbor.</p>

<p>“Walter!” said a voice as he was passing
the post&ndash;office. He turned quickly. A young
woman had just left Miss P. Green’s headquarters,
and was calling to him. It was May Elliott.
She looked at him in her earnest way, her blue
eyes brightening as she said, “I only want to
say that I hope you won’t care for those stories
about you at the station. Your friends have
confidence in you, and don’t believe what has
been said against you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. That does me good. It’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
pretty hard to be accused when you are innocent.”</p>

<p>“Well, you wait. The truth will come out;
and when it comes, you will be justified. Oh,
there is something else on my mind. Did you
know that Chauncy Aldrich was sick?”</p>

<p>“I only heard that he was indoors with some
trouble.”</p>

<p>“They say he is pretty sick, and Miss P.
Green, where he is boarding, says he is low&ndash;spirited.
I did not know but that you might
like to call and see him.”</p>

<p>Waiter declared that he would go at once.
He found Chauncy in a little room with a single
window. From this there was a view across
the white snowfields to the blackish ocean,
scowling angrily like an immense eye under a
dark, heavy lid of cloud. Chauncy was lying
on his bed, his head raised a little that he
might look out upon the winter scenery. His
eyes were bright but somber, and his hands
were thin and white. That cold bath to which
his uncle had unceremoniously treated him, and
which he afterwards attempted to explain as
a “little joke,” had provoked the sickness so
bleaching and weakening and thinning the
once vigorous young trader. Every feature
showed the effect of the hard fever that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
attacked him. Even the knob of hair that was
so accustomed to bristle on Chauncy’s head
and silently to defy all the world, had now
been humbled. His hair in a thick, tangled
mass, suggested a fort in ruins.</p>

<p>“Plympton, how are you? I’m real glad to
see you. Sit down, old boy. Where have
you been all this time?”</p>

<p>“At the station, you know. They tie us
pretty tight, but it is my day off. I’m real
sorry you are sick, Aldrich.”</p>

<p>“O thank you! Guess I shall pull through
it, but it’s awful hard to be cooped up here,”
and as he said this, he kicked at the bed&ndash;clothes
with a sudden energy. “A business man, you
know, that is used to stirring, can’t come down
to this easily. I’m real glad you came in.
Say, are you going up to your uncle’s?”</p>

<p>“I thought I should.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;”</p>

<p>Chauncy hesitated. He wished to say something
about his Uncle Bezaleel. He did not
know very much about Baggs’ business relations
to Boardman Blake. In spite of Baggs’
blustering display of confidence in his nephew,
any ostentatious intimations that Chauncy knew
everything about his business in general, Chauncy
knew very little. One reason was that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
uncle’s business, after all the brag, was very
limited, and then Bezaleel knew that Chauncy
had too much principle to back him in certain
dishonest schemes. The young man now
hesitated, impelled to say something about his
uncle, and yet held back by an unwillingness to
damage one with whom he had been associated.</p>

<p>“I guess you had better go to your uncle’s,
Plympton. There is going to be a conference
there, I believe, my uncle and his lawyer, and
your uncle and his lawyer, and oh, I don’t
know what else. Miss Green told me; and bless
me, what that mail&ndash;bag don’t know, isn’t worth
the knowing. She will hold more news than an
ocean steamer. Now mind, Plympton, I don’t
know what is up. Take my word for it. But
there is something to pay, and I would go
there.”</p>

<p>“I shall, most certainly,” and Walter’s eye
flashed like that of a watch dog who starts in
the night as he catches the stealthy step of a
burglar. “I hope it is nothing serious with
my uncle.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how it is; but two lawyers&mdash;that
means a rush in the market, Plympton;
yes, a rush.”</p>

<p>Chauncy ceased talking. His efforts at conversation
had already wearied him. He lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
upon his bed silently arguing a point. This
“rush in the market” meant a very significant
movement by his enterprising uncle, though its
exact nature was a mystery to Chauncy. His
uncle’s slippery ways had suggested to him one
occasion when he himself had been false to
Walter, and almost involuntarily he exclaimed,
as one may do in sickness that weakens the control
of the mind over itself,&mdash;”I don’t think I
ever tried to deceive you, save once. I hope
though you won’t hold it against me.”</p>

<p>Walter caught this confession imperfectly;
and what made him guess the occasion to
which Chauncy referred? Was it a chance
look out of the window toward the rocks of the
Crescent, about which the surf had wound
its scarf of snow? Walter thought of the day
when he saw Bezaleel Baggs on the shore
looking off toward the Chair. He was reminded
of Bezaleel’s resemblance to the mysterious
form he saw one morning in Boardman
Blake’s store, that morning when Chauncy Aldrich
so persistently tried to call off Walter’s
attention from the store. Walter now turned
suddenly to the invalid.</p>

<p>“Aldrich, see here. What do you mean by
saying you deceived me once? I can only
think of one time when I guess you did try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
pull the wool over my eyes, and I want you to
own up if it was so. Do you remember one
morning when I first came this way to stop?
I was opening my uncle’s store and you drove
down in a wagon, and I came out to the door
and saw you there, and I fancied I saw somebody
else in the store?”</p>

<p>Chauncy nodded his head in assent. Then
he added slowly, “That’s&mdash;the time&mdash;I mean,
too.”</p>

<p>“Look here! Wasn’t that your uncle inside
the store?”</p>

<p>Chauncy hesitated. He spoke at last, and
with sudden force. “Plympton, I don’t want to
deceive you now; but I did then, and am sorry.
It was my uncle in the store. Now, I don’t
want to go back on anybody, sick as I am. He
is my mother’s brother, if he isn’t what he
ought to be.” His lip quivered. He was
thinking of a mother, long ago at rest in death.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you mean that you don’t want me
to say anything about it, and that it will look
as if you had turned against your uncle. I
don’t think I need to speak of you. I saw
him with my own eyes, though I don’t know
what he was up to there in the store.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” whispered Chauncy.</p>

<p>“It is a satisfaction to have you confirm my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
opinion, and as for yourself anything between
us is all settled.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“There, I have bothered you too long. I
didn’t mean to stay here all this while.”</p>

<p>“I kept you, I kept you. Don’t go. It’s
fearful lonesome here, save when Green comes
up; and then she may look at me and say I make
her think of her brother who died, and cries&mdash;well,
that don’t help a feller; and I stay here
and think, you know. Say, Plympton!” Chauncy’s
eyes shone out bright and sharp. “Say, I
don’t want to die!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe you will. I am thinking
of this: soon as I get off from the station,&mdash;and
my time is up in a few days,&mdash;how would
you like to have me be your nurse? I could
sit with you, you know, and I am strong and
could lift you easily when you wanted to
change about.”</p>

<p>Strong? The very sight of the young surfman
so muscular and healthy was an elixir
to Chauncy. He seemed to take strength
from Walter at once, and certainly his own
stock needed reinforcement, for he was very
feeble.</p>

<p>Walter pitied him; “Poor fellow!” he
said, and Walter laid his hand on Chauncy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
forehead and gently stroked it. “I’m sorry for
you, and I’ll help you.”</p>

<p>The tears came in Chauncy’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Weak, you see, Plympton, weak as a baby.
I should like to have you come first rate. You
make&mdash;me&mdash;think&mdash;of my mother when she
was alive&mdash;she did that&mdash;put her hand there,
you know.” The tears came faster now.</p>

<p>“Now I would be quiet,” said Walter soothingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, this don’t hurt me, only when Green
comes and looks at me, as much as to say: ‘A
bad bargain, a bad bargain!’ See here, Plympton!
Do you remember May Elliott’s composition
at the Academy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m sure I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have thought of that a lot. You
might not think so, but I have, driving round
you know, a business man, watching the market,
you know. She said the life&mdash;what was
it?”</p>

<p>“The life that does not take others into account,
God and another life&mdash;that’s the idea&mdash;was
making a great mistake.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it; and lying here, I have said
to myself, ‘Aldrich, you’ve made a mistake.
You are buying stock that will fetch precious
little. Yes, a mistake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>’”</p>

<p>“Well, Aldrich, I won’t keep you talking;
but before I go, why not take God into account,
let me ask? Why not tell Him how
much you need Him, that you are sorry, and
want Him to help you to a better life, and that
you give yourself to Him?”</p>

<p>“He’d get a tremendous poor bargain if He
took me. All run down now.”</p>

<p>“God knows all that. Let’s see. What is
that verse about God commending His love toward
us, saying while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us?”</p>

<p>“Christ died for us! That does me good.
That’s like cold water when the fever is on and
you are fearful thirsty,” and Chauncy moved
his lips as if drinking.</p>

<p>“Then there is another verse&mdash;I don’t know
as I say it exactly, but I can give the idea&mdash;that
when we were without strength, Christ
died for the ungodly.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” and again a thirsty soul drank of
this cool goblet of good news.</p>

<p>“Plympton, I say!”</p>

<p>He spoke with much emphasis, as if he had
a matter of great importance to relate or a
favor to ask.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as you have a prayer handy
you could say, have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>Walter hesitated. What prayer could he
say that would help another? There was the
Lord’s Prayer, though. He could say that.
Kneeling and holding Chauncy by the hand&mdash;how
tightly Chauncy clung to that strong,
friendly hand&mdash;Walter began, “Our Father!”</p>

<p>“Our Father,” repeated Chauncy, and then
followed Walter through the prayer.</p>

<p>Walter added a few more words in which he
tried to approach an ever present, ever willing
Saviour, beseeching that Chauncy might be
helped right there to give himself entirely up
to God; braiding into his words, the touching,
solemn collect: “Assist us mercifully, O Lord,
in these our supplications and prayers.”</p>

<p>Walter then rose from his knees.</p>

<p>“That was another good drink,” Chauncy
said.</p>

<p>“I did not mean to stay so long, Aldrich.
Why, the tide is almost in,” said Walter, glancing
out of the window. “The Crescent is
pretty well covered.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t go!”</p>

<p>“Pretty well covered! What’s that verse?
It is about God’s forgiveness. I read it in the
Psalter last Sunday; ‘And covered all their
sins.’ That is the way it is with God’s mercy.”</p>

<p>And Walter thought of the tide coming in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
everywhere, and everywhere covering and hiding
the black rocks, the long, sandy bars, the
unsightly flats of mud, burying all under its
bright, shining, softly singing current.</p>

<p>Chauncy appreciated Walter’s meaning; and
when the latter left, Chauncy with a smile in
his face was looking afar and watching the
tide coming in.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">DARK DEPTHS UNCOVERED.</p>

<p>When Walter left Miss Green’s, he turned
away from the sea and walked rapidly
in the direction of his uncle’s. A sleigh
with jingling bells went by him. The driver of
the team was well protected against the cold,
and the style as well as the extent of the protection&mdash;the
rich buffalo robe snugly tucked
about his person, the handsome cap of fur that
could not wholly conceal his gray hair, the warm,
heavy, riding gloves of fur&mdash;showed that the
driver of the team did not have a mean and
scanty share of this world’s goods. The bright,
sharp, intelligent eyes under the rich cap of fur
gave evidence that the owner of the team was
smart enough and shrewd enough to hold
whatever he had gained and also add to it.</p>

<p>“Do you know that man?” Walter said to
Jabez Wherren, who, twisted up by the cold,
was moving slowly, shiveringly, over the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“That man! He’s Squire Tuck, your uncle’s
lawyer. He lives in Groveton.”</p>

<p>“He looks as if he knew something.”</p>

<p>“Knows suthin! For what he knows, I
wouldn’t swap all the clams ’tween here and
Novy Scoshy,” replied Jabez, who was a
famous clam digger, and all his estimates of
value were determined by one famous standard,
a clam.</p>

<p>“Then,” thought Walter, “Squire Tuck is on
his way to that meeting at uncle’s that Chauncy
spoke about. That is my guess.”</p>

<p>He soon came in sight of the well&ndash;known
buildings so associated with his life the past
autumn. There was the old&ndash;fashioned house from
whose big, red chimney lazily drifted the purplish
smoke. There was the store. There was the
sign above the door. And there at the post
before the door, was Squire Tuck’s horse.</p>

<p>“And there’s another team at the other
post,” said Walter. “Guess that is Baggs’
team.”</p>

<p>When he entered the store, he noticed that a
row of nails near the door opening into the
sitting&ndash;room had been already covered with hats
and coats. And who was the thief that Walter
saw near one of the coats, lifting its folds and
examining them with such intentness of look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
that the ringing of the bell above the door as
Walter entered, was scarcely noticed?</p>

<p>“Guess those bright eyes don’t see me,”
thought Walter. “I can say, ‘Caught at last.’
I’ll make the door&ndash;bell tap again.”</p>

<p>Jingle, jingle, jingle!</p>

<p>“Massy, Walter! how you skat me! Where
did you come from? Now you’ll say you’ve
got me a&ndash;peekin’ at folkses’ clothes. I don’t
care if you have. Jest come here!” and Aunt
Lydia mysteriously beckoned with a piece of
cloth. Lifting the skirt of a blue frock conspicuously
ornamented with big silver buttons,
Aunt Lydia fitted this bit of cloth into the torn
lining.</p>

<p>“There!” said she triumphantly. “The myst’ry
is out. I haven’t ben a&ndash;savin’ this all this
time for nothin’.”</p>

<p>“Why, whose coat is this?”</p>

<p>“It is that <i>Thing’s</i>, that Bel&ndash;ze&ndash;bub’s!”</p>

<p>“Baggs’? Oh, yes, I’ve seen him with it on.
I remember now.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you want to know what I’m up
to. Do you remember the fust mornin’ you
were clerk and opened the store? Wall, that
mornin’ I seed that Bel&ndash;ze&ndash;bub at the settin’&ndash;room
winder, as ef he were a&ndash;lookin’ in, though
he seemed to be a good way in; and arter that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
I found this piece of cloth on the blind. Now
I think he was not so much a&ndash;lookin’ in as
a&ndash;gittin’ out, and tore his linin’ while he was
a&ndash;tryin’ to accomplish that gentlemanly action;
and ef&mdash;and ef&mdash;” said the old lady, dropping
her voice, but intensifying her emphasis, “ef
he don’t keep out of my settin’&ndash;room, I’ll&mdash;I’ll
scald him! There!”</p>

<p>Walter was as much excited as his Aunt Lydia.</p>

<p>“There, Aunt, that just confirms me in what
I believe and know, that Baggs was in the store
that morning when I had stepped out on to the
doorstep.”</p>

<p>“In the store? Where? To buy suthin’?”</p>

<p>“Back of the counter, where uncle keeps
those books&mdash;that Bible, you know, and so on.
He went out from the store into the sitting&ndash;room,
and then through the window undoubtedly.”
Walter told the story of the strange
appearance in the store, the first morning of his
clerkship. While Aunt Lydia was expressing
her amazement, exclaiming, “Oh dear!” “Did
you ever!” “Pizen!” the door into the store
from the sitting&ndash;room opened, and there was
the driver of the sleigh that Walter had so particularly
noticed that morning, Squire Tuck.
His sharp, keen eyes searched the store rapidly,
and he said, “Ah, Mrs. Blake, you here? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
wanted to see you one moment and ask you
about a matter. Won’t you walk in, please?”</p>

<p>Aunt Lydia stepped toward the opened door,
and with one hand that she held behind her
back, she beckoned to Walter to follow. Walter
did not wait for a second flourish from that
mute object, but walked after Aunt Lydia and
stood silently behind her, as if a special bodyguard
to attend her and see that she suffered
no harm.</p>

<p>It was an unusual scene witnessed that morning
in the old&ndash;fashioned sitting&ndash;room. There
on one side of a large square table in the center
of the room, sat Baggs. He was very smiling,
and when Aunt Lydia entered he very politely
said, “Good mornin’, Miss Blake.” Near
him sat his lawyer, who looked somewhat like
Baggs, a stout individual with crafty eyes, who
signed himself “P. Allston Varney.” If the
middle name had been “All&ndash;stone,” somebody
once said, it would have been an appropriate
title. Opposite Baggs was his victim, Uncle
Boardman, and he sat there with an astonished
air. The vacant chair near Uncle Boardman
had been occupied by Squire Tuck. After calling
Aunt Lydia, he did not resume his seat, but
remained standing, and proceeded to address
the lady he had admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Blake,” he said courteously&mdash;Squire
Tuck always had a dignified, stately way of
addressing the ladies, bowing slightly as he
spoke,&mdash;“I wish to ask you about this note.”</p>

<p>P. Allston Varney closely watched Squire
Tuck as he picked up a document lying before
Baggs. It was a piece of paper in the form of
a money&ndash;note, long and narrow. Walter’s attention
was arrested immediately by the discovery
of a blot in the corner of the note, and
it made him think of the document he saw in
the store the morning of Baggs’ visit, carrying
in one corner a blot like a pig.</p>

<p>“There’s that pig again,” he was saying to
himself, when Squire Tuck remarked, “Before
asking the question I have in mind, let me
make an explanation. Your husband, Mrs.
Blake, gave Mr. Baggs a note for five hundred
dollars in return for money lent him that
he might build the saw&ndash;mill. That is all he
had against&mdash;I mean all that Mr. Baggs had
against your husband, so the latter asserts. It
became due the other day, and your husband
went to pay it. I suppose you know this, and
that it was paid also.”</p>

<p>Aunt Lydia nodded assent.</p>

<p>“And you know that Baggs presented another
note&mdash;this one for fifteen hundred dollars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
which indeed is in your husband’s handwriting,
he allows, but says he never gave it, and
can’t explain it. This you know?”</p>

<p>“I know what Baggs says, but my husband
don’t owe him any sich sum.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” exclaimed P. Allston Varney provokingly,
while Baggs looked towards his lawyer
with an amused air, as much as to say,
“Only think of it!”</p>

<p>“As you generally know about your husband’s
affairs, Mrs. Blake, what I wished to
ask was, if you knew of any such document&mdash;but
you have already implied that you did not&mdash;and
could throw any light in any way upon
this subject, and you might look at this and
examine it.”</p>

<p>Baggs and Varney both stirred in their chairs
and half arose, as if to intercept the passage
of the precious document into Mrs. Blake’s
hands.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the Squire, “I will guarantee that
no harm comes to the note. I will hold it and
you can stand by and watch every thing done.”</p>

<p>As the note was thus held before Aunt Lydia’s
sharply scrutinizing spectacles, her bodyguard
in the rear looked over her shoulders
and quickly read it.</p>

<p>“There is that pig!” thought Walter. “Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
it’s the same sort of looking document, only the
other said five hundred, and not fifteen.”</p>

<p>The sun outdoors had been endeavoring to
pierce the clouds and succeeded for a few moments,
and a bright, needle&ndash;like ray darted
through the window and fell on the note.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that ‘fifteen’ have a scratched
look?” thought Walter. An idea came to
him as if into his brain also a sunray had
darted, making a sudden light there. It was
not Walter’s nature to conceal anything, and
he burst out saying, “Squire, may I call attention&mdash;”</p>

<p>Baggs immediately grew red in the face
and nudged his lawyer, who sprang upon his
feet at once.</p>

<p>“Who’s this talking? I object, Squire. He
was not asked here!” shouted Varney.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is all right,” rejoined Squire Tuck,
his tone and manner quieting and assuring.
“Let the young man speak. You know, Squire
Varney, it wouldn’t look well to shut him up.
He may have something valuable to say, and
truth will always stand criticism.”</p>

<p>Amid grunting by Varney and head&ndash;shaking
by Baggs, Walter proceeded: “I wanted to call
attention to this note. I saw it the first morning
I was here, and I know it was that by that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
blot which it seemed to me looked like a
pig.”</p>

<p>“Pig!” ejaculated Varney, with a sneer.
“Some folks see themselves in everything
they look at.”</p>

<p>“Ha&mdash;ha!” roared Baggs.</p>

<p>“Let the young man proceed,” calmly remarked
Squire Tuck.</p>

<p>Walter was not used to encounters of this
kind, and he felt as if a head&ndash;wind had struck
him. He recovered himself, though, and began
to speak again.</p>

<p>A saucy answer was on the end of his
tongue, but he remembered something his father
said once, that in a discussion the man
more likely to come out ahead is the man who
can control his tongue as well as use it. He held
to his point like a vessel to its course and said,
“I saw something on that note which it may
be wished I had not seen. The words ‘five
hundred’ were then on it, not ‘fifteen hundred,’
and&mdash;and&mdash;that ‘fifteen’ to me has a
scratched look.”</p>

<p>Everything was in intense confusion. Uncle
Boardman jumped upon his feet, crying, “Let
me see! I lost one note and gave another.”
Varney shouted, advancing towards Walter,
“Do you mean to say that my client<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
is a forger? that Bezaleel Baggs is guilty of
scratching notes?”</p>

<p>Walter had no opportunity to reply, for a
woman’s sharp voice piped forth, “Well, I
mean to say that Beelzebub is equal to scratchin’
notes.”</p>

<p>“Who, madame?” politely asked Squire
Tuck. “Undoubtedly that person is equal
to the operation.”</p>

<p>“I mean&mdash;<i>him</i>!” declared Aunt Lydia, boldly
pointing toward B. Baggs. “Before we came
in here, my nephew here and me were a&ndash;comparin’
idees, and from what he says and the
way this note looks, I think Beelzebub&mdash;I
think&mdash;yes, I’ll stick to it, that’s his name&mdash;came
into the store, took that note where he
must have found out my husband kept sich
things, his Bible in the store&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You certainly did know, Mr. Baggs,” said
Uncle Boardman. “I remember you asked me
about the time I gave the note, if I had a safe
where I kept things, and I said I was apt to
tuck notes and things into my Bible in the
store,&mdash;a careless way I allow.”</p>

<p>“From his Bible, took the note,” resumed
Aunt Lydia, “cleared out through the winder
in my sittin’&ndash;room, and there’s the rag your
coat&mdash;now in the entry&mdash;left behind when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
climbed out and tore the linin’!” Here Aunt
Lydia held up before Baggs the little rag that
she had so carefully retained.</p>

<p>All but Baggs had risen and were eagerly
scrutinizing the note. Inwardly, Baggs was
in a turmoil; outwardly, his face was flushed
and his crooked eye was rolling like a vessel
in a storm. When he spoke, he showed
great self&ndash;control. His voice was placid as ever,
and he waved his great, fat hands as if quieting
an unnecessary tumult.</p>

<p>“Now, ladies and gentlemen, what’s all this
fuss for? I have doc&mdash;doc&mdash;doc&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Doctor?” suggested Varney, wishing to
help up his stumbling client. “Want the
doctor?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no! What kind of evidence do you
call it? Doc&mdash;doc&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Documentary?” suggested Squire Tuck.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Squire,” said Baggs, bowing
low. “I have dockermentry evidence about
this note, and it’s in the coat that Madame
Blake spoke about.”</p>

<p>Here Baggs bowed toward “Madame Blake.”</p>

<p>“And,” he continued, “if you will permit
me, I will bring the very coat, and splain that
rag business too.”</p>

<p>Here he triumphantly looked about upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
auditors as if he were carrying a point in the
town meetings, where he had been famous as an
orator.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will bring the coat, this very moment”&mdash;and
as he spoke, he rose and stepped
toward the door into the store&mdash;“and no one
need feel s’cluded from the investigation. All
please stay here. Our young friend there”&mdash;he
pointed toward Walter&mdash;“may remain. I will
satisfy all&mdash;yes&mdash;I will&mdash;” and he was gone.</p>

<p>“Well,” declared Squire Tuck, “this is interesting
business,” and he looked toward Varney.</p>

<p>“Yes, but just wait and give the man a chance
to speak for himself. It’s a serious thing to
charge a man with forgery.”</p>

<p>“I should think, sir,” roared Uncle Boardman,
“to take away a man’s property was a
pretty serious matter also!”</p>

<p>“Yes; serious, vile, imperdent, reskelly&mdash;”
Aunt Lydia stood with opened mouth pouring
out a torrent of hot adjectives, when Squire
Tuck interrupted her and interrupted also the
tumult that had become general, saying,
shouting rather, “Now all be quiet! We want
to hear from Baggs. He ought to have got
that coat by this time.”</p>

<p>The Squire stepped to the door into the store
and opened it, wishing to assist the tardy Baggs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
“Allow me, Brother Tuck, the pleasure of helping
you,” said Varney with much politeness,
and he followed the Squire who had stepped
out into the store. Those in the sitting&ndash;room
now heard one word from the Squire and it
came in no gentle tones: “Gone!” What a
rush there was from that sitting&ndash;room!</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Aunt Lydia, “why didn’t
I hold on to that coat while I had the chance!”</p>

<p>“I know now why he was so willing that
‘our young friend’ should stay in the sitting&ndash;room,”
remarked Walter.</p>

<p>“But how did he get out?” inquired Uncle
Boardman. “We did not hear the door&ndash;bell
ring.”</p>

<p>“There!” shouted the Squire, pointing at
an opened window. “He was cunning enough
not to ring that door&ndash;bell.”</p>

<p>“Then he’s used to climin’ through folks’
winders,” said Aunt Lydia sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t I arrest him on the spot?
Scatter, everybody, and chase hard! Come
out here!” cried the Squire, and his gray hairs
led off in the scramble made for the store
door. The little bell rang violently now, and
out they rushed, Aunt Lydia as forward as any.</p>

<p>“He didn’t take any sleigh, you see, for we
would have noticed that from the windows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the sitting&ndash;room. You come too!” said the
Squire to Don Pedro, who, bare&ndash;headed, chanced
to be coming from the direction of the kitchen.
He had been almost asleep in a snug warm
corner back of the stove, but the late banging
of the door and that violent ringing of the door&ndash;bell
had fully aroused him. He had hastily
come out to see what the matter was. Wishing
to avoid the company in the sitting&ndash;room, he
had not tried to reach the store from that quarter,
and trying another way, he succeeded in
meeting the company by the doorstep.</p>

<p>“What fur?” asked Don Pedro, with widening
eyes.</p>

<p>“To chase that rascal, Baggs,” said Squire
Tuck.</p>

<p>“Dis moment I’m ready! I’ll go for him!
Whar?”</p>

<p>“Get a hat! Be awful spry.”</p>

<p>Interpreting a hat as meaning any hat, Don
Pedro went into the store, and took the first
hat he saw in the line where Baggs and others
had hung their wearing apparel.</p>

<p>“Mr. Blake,” said Squire Tuck, “you go
along the road through the woods, rousing
neighbors and making inquiries. I’ll take my
team and dash down to The Harbor and rouse
them there. Walter, you take the woods themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
striking in at the left; and you, boy,”
(addressing Don Pedro) “take the woods over
here at the right. If you see Baggs, grip him
and then shout for help, but hold him!”</p>

<p>Off went this police force, Uncle Boardman
impressing into his constabulary force his
patient old mare that chanced to be already
harnessed to a red pung, and standing in a shed
at the rear of the house. Squire Tuck sprang into
his sleigh, eagerly caught up the reins and was
about to dash off, when he said to Varney,
“The counsel on the other side can join in the
pursuit, if he wishes.”</p>

<p>Varney’s answer was a look of scorn. He
went to a corner of the house that gave him a
short view of this interesting chase, and there
watched Uncle Boardman who urged on the
old mare as if a whirlwind were after him.
Aunt Lydia was anxious to have a hand in the
hunt. Closing and locking the store door, securing
all others, even the back door, as she passed
out, lest “the pest” might get in again, she
determined to search the barn. Armed with a
pitchfork, she visited every corner she could
think of, prudently sending her fork ahead and
thoroughly “jabbing” the darkness of any nook
before giving it personal examination. No enemy
could be found. If one had been there, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
such a reconnoissance with the pitchfork, he
would have come out more dead than alive.
Aunt Lydia chanced to think of one more place
that might hide the fugitive. It was a little
tool closet. She had laid down her weapon of
search, as the door required a tug with both
hands. The door yielded and flew open. And
there in one corner, she spied a pair of sharp,
black eyes!</p>

<p>“Massy!” exclaimed Aunt Lydia, turning to
flee, but stumbling and falling. “Oh&mdash;h&mdash;h!”
she screamed. “It’s he! Help&mdash;p!”</p>

<p>The next moment, she was conscious that a
spring had been made over her shoulders,
and out of the barn&ndash;door went Billy, the old
black cat, mad to think he had been carelessly
shut up twenty&ndash;four hours in that hungry place.
And Aunt Lydia, who had previously thought
she would be so glad to find Baggs, was just as
glad now that this occupant of the tool closet
was not Baggs, and went into the house
thoroughly satisfied. The others still kept up
the pursuit. Squire Tuck roused The Harbor
after a fashion not known for years. Uncle
Boardman stirred up every farmhouse on his
road. Walter and Don Pedro searched the
woods, but in silence. The command had been
not to shout until a seizure had been made and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
help was needed. The snow was not very deep
in the woods, and progress was not difficult.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything!” thought Walter.
“A fox has been along there, I guess, and
those are a man’s tracks; but they are old ones.”</p>

<p>Through the silent forest, under the green
roof of the pines, across a frozen brook, Walter
vigorously pushed. He saw nothing suspicious,
heard nothing. “Caw&mdash;caw!” went an occasional
crow overhead, but it was not Baggs forsaking
his feet and taking to wings. Walter
reached at last a low but vigorous young growth
of spruce. Above their tops, did he see a gray
stove&ndash;pipe hat? Did not Baggs wear such a
hat that day? Walter’s heart leaped within him.</p>

<p>“It’s Baggs’ hat!” he excitedly declared.
“Now if he don’t see me and dodge me, and if
I can just follow him without his noticing me a
few moments, I’ll slip up to him so near that
though he may dodge all he pleases, I&mdash;shall
have him!”</p>

<p>Suddenly, the hat&mdash;was it turning? Did
Baggs see Walter, possibly? Walter stooped,
then rose again, only to declare that the wearer
was turning to make an observation. Several
times this was done, and each time Walter
slightly bowed himself to escape observation.
Then the hat began to move rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s running!” thought Walter. “Now, go
for him sharp!”</p>

<p>It was a furious chase, but Walter did not
gain on that violently bobbing gray hat as he
anticipated. “He runs the fastest I ever saw,
for a short, fat man!” declared Walter. “I’ll
have him though.” He knew the woods well
enough to be aware that somewhere beyond
the low spruce growth was a swamp, and a bad
one. He had heard Uncle Boardman say
that the swamp was not frozen, lately.</p>

<p>“That feller,” thought Walter, “will find he
can’t cut through that swampy place so easily.
It won’t hold him, and he will have to keep to
the edge of the spruces and come out down here
to the left, and I will aim for that point and meet
him there, surprise and welcome him, and say,
‘How do you do, Mr. Baggs? Fine day!’
Ha&mdash;ha!”</p>

<p>Would Walter’s confident predictions be successful?
That agitated old hat of gray was
forced by the yet yielding swamp to keep to
the left, only to be met by Walter, who in turn
found under the hat a surprise, even&mdash;Don
Pedro!</p>

<p>“Why, Don, you&mdash;booby, I’ve been chasing
you all this time?”</p>

<p>Don Pedro’s eyes were large and staring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>“Walter, you&mdash;jes’ frighten me&mdash;a heap!
My&mdash;breff&mdash;clean gone&mdash;honey! Ef I didn’t
t’ink you’se a robber. Why&mdash;didn’t&mdash;you&mdash;holler,
an’ show&mdash;who you was?”</p>

<p>“Holler! We were told not to, till we got
something to holler about. It would have frightened
the game. What have you got on Baggs’
hat for? Oh dear&mdash;ha! ha! ha!” And Walter
leaned against a tree and laughed till he was
sore.</p>

<p>“Me got Baggs’ hat? Squire said I might
hab any, an’ I tuk the fus’ one handy. And do
you want to know why I ran so hard? Back
dar a piece I met a man, and he looked bad, and
he was a handlin’ a knife sort ob careless, a bad
looking knife.”</p>

<p>Don Pedro rolled his eyes about tragically as
he told his story, deepening his voice as he went
on.</p>

<p>“I axed him ef he had seen a man by de
name ob Baggs who had probed hisself to be a
reskel, an’ we was a&ndash;hantin’ fur him. He
opened his knife and felt the edge sort ob careless
an’ tole me I’d better leab; dat ef he foun’
me in dese woods agin, I’d nebber hab a chance
to leab ’em. Dat Baggs he said was whar I
couldn’t tech him, an’ he ’vised me fur to go
hum. When I saw you, I s’posed it was him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
an’ didn’t I run! I jest saw a hat and didn’t
s’pose you was under it, but dat man, an’ it took
de bref out ob me! What will ye do now?”</p>

<p>“The hunt for Baggs, I guess, is up. However,
we will make sure and go to the end of
the woods, and there are two or three houses
along there. The people will tell us if any
sign of Baggs has been seen.”</p>

<p>The end of the wood&ndash;lot was reached and inquiries
were made at the farmhouses. No footprint
of the runaway could be discovered anywhere,
and Walter told Don Pedro they would
go no farther.</p>

<p>“We might as well take to the woods again
on our way back. I’d like to see who that fellow
is round with a knife and telling what he
will do. We will stop that nonsense.” Don
Pedro only needed a leader to be as brave a
soldier as ever followed a flag, and he readily
assented. Nothing came from the return
search. No object more hostile than a squirrel
was seen, and he gave a very friendly wink
with his bright eyes as he peeped out of his snug
quarters for the winter. Don Pedro’s use of
the wrong hat was not the only case of the
kind that occurred. Miss Green called the
evening of that day.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Blake, you ought to have seen that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
lawyer, that Varney, to&ndash;day. He came riding
by the post&ndash;office with a handkerchief tied
round his head, and somebody said they saw
him prancing round your house, trying every
door, and he was as bare&ndash;headed as a bean when
it has been shelled. I believe he borrowed a hat
round here.”</p>

<p>“There!” said Aunt Lydia, “I must have
locked that man out afore I went to the barn!
But there was no hats left on the nails where
his things had been, for I looked up to ’em myself
and there was nothin’ there when I went
to the barn.”</p>

<p>No, there were only naked nails in the wall.
As for Varney’s hat, it had gone off on the head
of Baggs, who had seized the first hat he met in
his hasty exit, a conclusion the lawyer himself
reached when making subsequent inquiries.</p>

<p>Guilty Baggs had gone&mdash;nobody knew where.
And the mystery of that man with the knife, in
the woods? It was minutely discussed at the
station, where Joe Cardridge had suddenly disappeared,
leaving only a message for the keeper
saying he would be back soon and prove that
Walter Plympton was “a good deal wuss than
he ought to be.” Joe coolly wished also to have
his place kept for him.</p>

<p>“I guess not,” remarked the keeper. “A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
man going off that way without a notice, will
have to wait a long time before he has a notice
that he is wanted again. I will fill his place at
once. Tucker Jones is home from his winter
fishin’, and I will get him.”</p>

<p>Tucker Jones, a big&ndash;boned, rugged young
fisherman, was quickly established in the vacant
berth.</p>

<p>“Walter,” said Tom Walker, “putting all
things together, I think it was Joe Cardridge
that scared Don Pedro in the woods. He was
a&ndash;hangin’ round the store somebody said. Probably
he knew what was goin’ on, and followed his
master, that Baggs. They were seen together
by a man five miles from here. It is good that
he has gone.”</p>

<p>Nobody lamented his departure, not even his
family. His wife and children could manage
without him, and far more agreeably. At the
station, the only element of dissension in the
crew was now taken away. All noticed the
harmony that marked the station life.</p>

<p>“It only takes one stone in a fellow’s shoe,”
remarked Tom Walker, “to upset everything,
and Joe Cardridge has been the stone in the
shoe.”</p>

<p>Walter now fully enjoyed his life. True,
there were rough, wild beats before him, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the warm, cheerful shelter followed them. Then
there was the constant sense of danger from
that vast, uneasy sea, to give flavor to a life that
might otherwise become insipid.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” he thought, “that my time at
the station is almost up. It’s up in a few days,
and I wonder when the district superintendent
will be here to investigate my trouble. I don’t
care for it. Let them hunt. I am right.”</p>

<p>Yes, let slanders and envy hunt through our
lives, and if we are right, who cares?</p>

<p>Keeper Barney had said, “Joe’s goin’ off
leaves Walter without an accuser, and I can’t
easily believe he is wrong, but there is that bottle!
What about that?”</p>

<p>Yes, the flask, what about that? Joe had
gone, but the flask remained on a shelf, and
Walter still was confronted by this dumb,
black accuser.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="pch">A WILD STORM.</p>

<p>At a life saving station, there are various
drills in which the surfmen are exercised.
There is the beach apparatus
drill. “Open boat&ndash;room doors! Man the beach
wagon!” shouts the keeper. Every man knows
his place, the doors are opened, and the cart is
rushed out. “Forward!” cries the keeper, and
each man knows just where to station himself
and pull. Then come the other orders. “Halt!
Action!” A pole representing a wreck, the
men proceed as if attempting a rescue, sending
a line to the wreck. Then come other orders.
“Man weather whip! Haul out! Man lee
whip!”</p>

<p>“Haul ashore!” and the buoy for conveying
the crew supposed to be wrecked, travels backward
and forward as often as desired. Then
there is the boat practice, and the boat must
be launched through the surf, and the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
drilled in the management of the oars. The
crew must also practice with signals. Stations
may be near enough to communicate with
one another, and this is done in the day time
with flags and in the night with star rockets
and Coston lights. An example would be
the showing of a red flag by day and the
burning of a red Coston light and firing of
a red rocket by night. It is the danger
signal, and means that a wreck has been seen,
or a vessel is discovered to be in need of
help. By means of the box of flags that every
station keeps under its roof, the crew can talk
with any vessel off shore and needing assistance.
The crew must also be practiced in methods of
restoring the apparently drowned. It was one
dreary, rainy day that Keeper Barney was
drilling the crew in these last methods. Cook
Charlie had offered himself as a subject on
whom the crew might practice. The keeper
commenced a list of questions, asking: “What
first is to be done to the patient?” Cook Charlie
stretched upon the floor submitted patiently
to the pressing and pounding and other parts
of the process of resuscitation.</p>

<p>It was not a practice that on a dreary winter
day when the sea was wrathfully roaring, could
be classified as pleasantly suggestive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>While they were resuscitating Cook Charlie,
Walter glanced occasionally out of the window.
The sea rapidly roughened, and huge waves
were launching on the sands broken and angry
masses of surf. A ragged curtain of fog was
drawn across the rim of the sea, but it was only
ragged near the shore. Farther out, its denseness
was without a seam. The day ended with
many jokes about Cook Charlie, the resuscitated
mariner, but mingled with the laughter
were dismal cries of the storm. The rain could
be heard splashing against the window panes,
and occasionally the whole window shook as if
a violent hand had been laid upon it. All the
while, there was the wrathful thunder of the sea
as if over some invisible bridge just above the
station, the heavy squadrons of the storm were
gloomily marching. Still, around the old cook
stove whose fire burnt jollily, echoed the laughter
of the surfmen as they cracked their jokes
and told humorous stories of the sea. So the
evening wore away. The storm yet raged. As
the different patrolmen arrived, they came with
dripping hats, with faces wet by the storm, with
clothes that hung stiffly about them.</p>

<p>“It’s a howlin’ night,” reported Tom Walker,
slamming his lantern on the table.</p>

<p>“Just so at my end of the beach,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Woodbury Elliott, who immediately followed
Tom. “Whew&mdash;w&mdash;w! An old&ndash;fashioned nor’easter!”
“You saw nothin?” inquired Capt.
Barney. And each patrol said, “Not a thing.”</p>

<p>“I hope it will stay so, for I think it’s goin’ to
be the wust of the season. Come, boys, all pile
upstairs early. There’s some hard trampin’ to
be done ’fore daybreak.”</p>

<p>“Wall, we can say we have resuscitated one
man to&ndash;day,” said Slim Tarleton.</p>

<p>“Ah, but we may have some real cases to&ndash;morrow.
God forbid!”</p>

<p>It was Walter’s watch in the morning, from
four till sunrise. He slept uneasily till his
watch, vexed by dreams of wreck and rescue,
of dead men’s faces and living wives’
sorrow. Rising, he dressed himself hurriedly a
little before four. How the building shook in
the wind, while the sea without was furious in
its uproar!</p>

<p>“I’d like to stay in that warm bed. Booh!
That cold walk makes me shiver! No help for
it,” thought Walter, as he moved reluctantly toward
the stairway and then descended it.</p>

<p>In the kitchen, dripping like a fish just pulled
out of the water, was Slim Tarleton. He had
finished his watch and Walter was his successor.</p>

<p>“I’d like to go for you, Walter, but it’s four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
now, and morning’s not such a terrible way
off.”</p>

<p>“All quiet?”</p>

<p>“Everything except the sea, and that acts as
bad as it can. Oh, I don’t imagine there will be
any trouble.”</p>

<p>“Here is your Coston light, time&ndash;detector and
so on,” said Keeper Barney. “Dress snug, for it
blows; and dress thick, for it is cold. If anything
happens, let us know.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, Cap’n!” and out into the dark and
the cold and the rain, strode our young knight,
looking in his storm gear more like an Eskimo
than a representative of any knightly age. The
north&ndash;east wind blew at him as if it wanted to
push this meddler back into the station; but with
one arm around his lantern as if it were a baby
that he wished to shield, he struggled over the
rocks down to the strip of sand not yet covered
by the tide. He saw nothing ten feet away, but
he heard&mdash;no pen can describe the bellowing of
this monster plunging and frothing at his feet.
The lantern shot little gleams of light on the
confused masses of foam along the edge of the
shore, and he knew that there was a tumbling
wall of ghastly white just beyond.</p>

<p>“What if my lantern should go out!” he exclaimed
nervously. He turned from the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and unbuttoning his outside coat, folded it
around his lantern, letting out only enough
light to show him where to plant his feet. Then
he struggled on. It was a hard walk in a storm
that had no mercy. He was pushing ahead,
when, lifting his face to the wild rain and attempting
to look through it, he saw&mdash;a jagged
line of fire curving up into the air! The next
moment, he trembled with excitement.</p>

<p>“A wreck!” was the thought flashing through
his mind. That one glance at the rocket above
the sea seemed to change into an antelope the
slowly plodding surfman. He sprang over the
rocks that lined the beach. There was an ice
wall that had bothered him a minute ago, but
he now mastered it and climbed to high ground.
Drawing out his signal, he fired it, and then
waving madly this crimson answer of hope to a
mariner’s prayer of fire, he ran to the station.
Over fragments of ice, into pools of water,
along sharp ledges, he flew as if some kindly
power had withdrawn his cowhide boots and
furnished him with wings instead; but how
much faster he did want to go! If he were
only electricity, or light itself, and could shoot
to the station at once! He reached it though,
finally. Keeper Barney was sitting by the
stove trying to read, when Walter threw open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
the kitchen door, and burst in, waving his
lantern and crying, “A wreck! Quick!”</p>

<p>“Heavens, boy! In this storm! All hands
turn out!” he screamed, even before he reached
the foot of the stairs leading up to the crew’s
room. He must have repeated it half a dozen
times, on his way to their beds. The next
moment there were several bounces upon the
floor. After a hurried dressing, there was a
confused rushing for the stairs. Men appeared
wearing one boot and lugging the other, or
with half their clothes in their arms, while Tucker
Jones, the man who took Joe Cardridge’s
place, was trying to work his arms through the
legs of his pants, thinking he was handling his
jacket. Seavey Lowd, the other patrol, now arrived,
or rather came rushing in, shouting and
confirming the news. The little living&ndash;room
was confused with excitement, the men hurrying
here and there, trying to find hat or jacket
or coat; and several were trying hard to find
their senses. Keeper Barney had his, now, and
he spoke coolly to the men.</p>

<p>“Now listen, boys! Steady! It will be useless
to take the boat. We must go out with
the beach apparatus. Do as well as you can.
You all know your places. Hit as high a mark
as you can.” As he spoke, he lead the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
into the boat&ndash;room, and then he issued the familiar
order: “Open boat&ndash;room doors! Man the
beach wagon!”</p>

<p>How those young Titans worked! The outer
doors flew open, and a strong, cold draft of
wintry air rushed in. Every man knew his
place in hauling. Two gripped the shafts, four
laid hold of the drag ropes.</p>

<p>“Forward!” rang out the word of command
from the keeper, who followed with his lantern.</p>

<p>Through the thick slush or over masses of ice,
the cart was dragged to the sands which the
tide had not flooded.</p>

<p>“There’s the wreck!” some one shouted, or
tried to shout amid the roar of the surf. An
arrow of fire shooting up into the night shadows
still lingering on the sea, showed the crew
that they must go farther down the beach.
What a wearisome journey with the cart it
was!</p>

<p>“Cheer ’em up with a Coston light, boys!”
the keeper would occasionally shout. At last,
when he judged they were about opposite the
wreck, he cried, “Halt!” There was a waiting
for the light, that the exact location of the
wreck might be declared, and in the meantime
all possible preparations for the rescue were
made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>The surf men knew what to do, as there had
been many drills in the handling of the apparatus.
Each man, according to his number, had
his particular piece of work. It was the place
of No. 4, Seavey Lowd, to throw the breeches
buoy off the cart, and Seavey did it. Walter,
as No. 6, was one of those that removed the
sand anchor, pick and shovel. The keeper, and
No. 1, Tom Walker, took the gun down. Nos. 2
and 3, Slim Tarleton and Woodbury Elliott,
removed the shot&ndash;line box.</p>

<p>“Bury the sand anchor up here!” called out
the keeper. The sand anchor consisted of two
stout pieces of hard wood, each six feet long,
two inches thick and eight wide. These were
crossed at their centers and securely fastened together.
A stout iron ring projected from the
center of the sand anchor. How rapidly pick
and shovel were worked, and a deep trench dug
in which the anchor was laid and there firmly
imbedded! This buried anchor was designed to
secure the shore end of the hawser to be sent
out to the wreck. The hawser terminated in a
double pulley&ndash;block, by which it could be tightened,
and a short rope gripped the block and the
anchor, binding them together. The “crotch”
was made of two stout pieces of wood ten feet
long. Near the top, these were crossed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
when set up suggested an X. It was No. 4,
Seavey Lowd, who looked after the crotch, and
at the proper time he was to set it up on the
beach. It was Seavey’s duty also to carry the
end of the hawser to the foot of the crotch over
which it was to be stretched to the sand anchor.</p>

<p>In the meantime the captain and Tom Walker
were supposed to look after the gun, while Slim
Tarleton and Woodbury Elliott were expected to
deposit the shot&ndash;line box about three feet from
the gun. The line had been coiled about pins
in a frame, and the latter was so arranged that it
could be removed, leaving the line wound in
diagonal loops, and at liberty to fly after the
shot to which it was to be attached. During the
interim of waiting, the life&ndash;car was also brought
from the station. That dismal wreck could at
last be plainly seen, about three hundred feet
from the shore. The spray boiled about the
dark hull as if it had been set in the crater of
a volcano. The excitement among the surfmen
increased. The keeper had loaded the gun, and
the shot had been inserted and the line tied to
an eye in the shank protruding from the shot.
The keeper stood in the rear of the gun, and
was sighting over it, shouting to Nos. 1 and 2,
“Right!” or “Left!” And they trained the
muzzle accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well!” he cried, and the gun came to a rest.</p>

<p>It was pointing at the wreck. The necessary
elevation was then given to the gun, and the
primer inserted. When everything was arranged,
the keeper shouted, “Ready!”</p>

<p>Whizz&mdash;z&mdash;bang&mdash;g&mdash;g!</p>

<p>Away went the shot, the line faithfully following.
How its flight was watched! Would
it fall short of the wreck and uselessly drop
into the water? No! it had fallen across the vessel
and the crew quickly seized it. A shout went
up from the surfmen: “Hur&mdash;rah&mdash;h! Hurrah&mdash;h&mdash;h!”
To the shot&ndash;line, was now tied
the “whip.” This was reeved through a single
pulley&ndash;block, making what is termed an
endless line. To it was attached a tally board
carrying printed directions in English and
French, telling those on board how to properly
secure this “whip” or endless line. Keeper
Barney was now signaling to the wreck.</p>

<p>“He means to have them haul the whip on
board,” thought Walter.</p>

<p>Quickly the whip line was going out to the
vessel, and was there made fast.</p>

<p>“They are signaling to us to go ahead, and
do the next thing,” thought Walter. All the
surfmen knew what that next thing was. The
whip had been secured to the sand anchor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
now Nos. 1 and 2, Tom Walker and Slim Tarleton
were handling the hawser, a still stouter line,
and they attached it to the whip. As the keeper
paid out the hawser, others manned the whip
and hauled off to the wreck the new sturdy
friend coming to the rescue. The men on the
vessel guided by a tally board attached to the
hawser, secured it to the mast a foot and a
half higher than the hauling line or whip.
On shore, the hawser had been stretched across
the crotch and connected with the sand anchor.
There now swung above the frothing breakers,
reaching from shore to ship, this stout hawser
four inches in circumference, and below it was
the endless line or whip. The breeches buoy
was now brought forward. This buoy consisted
of a cork life&ndash;preserver, circular, from
which hung canvas breeches with very short
legs. Four ropes that gripped the circle of cork,
met above in a ring of iron, and this was connected
with a block called a “traveler.” This
block was “snapped on to the hawser,” and
the ends of the whip were also bent into the
block&ndash;strap and secured. Then the buoy began
its travels to the wreck, the men hauling on
the whip. “Somebody has jumped into that
buoy,” cried Tom Walker as he watched the
wreck. Strong hands were laid on the whip, and
above the breakers danced the breeches buoy,
a man’s head and body now rising above it
while his legs dangled below.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here she comes!” sung out Slim Tarleton.</p>

<p>“Here <i>he</i> comes, I guess,” suggested Woodbury
Elliott.</p>

<p>Come, he did, nearer, nearer, the surfmen
steadily hauling on the line; and at last the
breeches buoy was in the midst of the brave
circle of rescuers.</p>

<p>“How are ye?” called out the occupant of
the buoy, a sharp&ndash;nosed, red&ndash;headed man.
“Much obleeged.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re welcome!” said Keeper Barney.</p>

<p>“How are all the folks at sea?” inquired
Tom Walker.</p>

<p>“Does it look nat’ral round here?” asked
Seavey Lowd.</p>

<p>“Altogether too nat’ral for me,” replied the
arrival by this ocean air&ndash;line. “Ef we didn’t
have a tough night!”</p>

<p>The man had now disembarked from this
canvas&ndash;and&ndash;cork ship, and stood on the sands.</p>

<p>The keeper was hurriedly giving the order to
“haul out,” when the stranger asked, “Haven’t
ye suthin’ bigger and snugger ye could send
out? Some of the folks there are awful weak.”</p>

<p>“Passengers?” inquired the keeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jest so.”</p>

<p>“All right. We will put on the life&ndash;car soon
as we get some of the crew ashore. People
can ride snug in that life&ndash;car. How long will
your craft hold together?”</p>

<p>“She’s a good deal smashed, Cap’n, but she
can stand it a while longer.”</p>

<p>“Man the weather&ndash;whip! Haul out!” the
keeper was shouting. Out to the wreck, the
breeches buoy traveled, and then returned with
its freight of a second man.</p>

<p>“Haul the hawser taut there!” cried the
keeper to Walter and Woodbury, who stood
near the sand anchor and handled the tackle
for tightening the hawser. Each rescued man
proved a rescuer, going to work at once. There
were three more brought ashore by the buoy,
and then the keeper ordered the life&ndash;car forward.
The buoy was quickly removed, and in its place
above the roaring surf hung the life&ndash;car, riding
along the hawser on its way to the wreck.
The life&ndash;car was shaped like a boat, made of
galvanized sheet iron. It was about eleven feet
long, three deep, and over four wide, and would
carry a load of six or seven persons. It was
roofed over, and its cargo was received through
a hatch which was securely covered, but little
openings in the top admitted the air. The car
had now gone to the wreck, had received its
load, and in response to the keeper’s “haul
ashore!” was traveling landward along the
hawser. It was a feeble, shivering lot of mortals
who crawled through the hatch at the end
of the trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-333.jpg" width="350" height="756"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">“<i>Come he did, nearer, nearer!</i>” <span class="reduct" style="font-weight: normal;">(p. <a href="#Page_321">321</a>)</span>.</p>
</div></div>

<p>“Any more?” asked the keeper. “Two and
the captain,” said an old man. Once more the
life&ndash;car was hauled out to the wreck, while
Walter was sent to the station with the chilled
passengers and a sailor whom the storm had
overcome. As Walter walked along the sands,
he watched the terrible agitation of the water
near him.</p>

<p>The sea would swell into long folds of angry
green, and these would rush toward the shore,
swelling, threatening, more and more angry,
greener, perhaps tipped with a scanty wreath
of foam, only to roll over menacingly, tumbling,
crashing in furious uproar, breaking into a
million bits of foam. As an opposing rock was
struck by a wave, this would be thrown up into
a huge mound of froth that broke all along
its summit into a delicate, misty veil of lace.
This wave was only the front rank of an army
whose name was legion, rolling, rushing in wrath
toward the land, breaking and foaming, clambering
up the high shore&ndash;ledges to vainly tear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
at them, smothering and drowning what could
not be rooted up and borne away. In what
faultless curves they turned over, these gigantic
billows when they struck the shore, rings of
emerald, wheels of porphyry, arcs of spheres of
crystal! Down, down, down, then plunged the
water, and these cataracts met their doom in a
hopeless swirl of surf. All along the beach
was the frothing tumble of these cascades of
the ocean. Beyond the shore&ndash;waves it was one
confusing mass of ghostly water, of white
hands lifted and white faces raised,&mdash;in pity and
prayer? No, in an anger where all color disappears,
where is only the aspect, of a wrath, ghastly
and awful. Occasionally some log would
come out of this wild whirlpool of the demons,
some fragment of a ship torn by the storm as if
an animal, limb from limb, and flung in scorn
upon the shore. What a tale each fragment
could have told! Perhaps it was a handful of
moss plucked from a rock, or a starfish, or the
tiniest mussels gathered up from the bottom of
the sea and then shot landward.</p>

<p>How the sea roared! It seemed as if into
that wild chorus all the notes of angry winds
and mad torrents, and the crash of thunder, and
the voices of men in their human wrath, and the
shouts of demons in their satanic fury had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
gathered, and now were let loose with all the
confusion of the fiercest hurricane. Now and
then, Walter thought he caught the dismal
groan of a fog&ndash;horn attached to a buoy at the
mouth of the river, and intended to warn mariners
of the nearness of sand bar and rockledge.
It was an illusion though, for who
in the storm could hear any such agency piping
out its feeble little note of warning?</p>

<p>In the meantime, the car had brought from
the wreck its last load. The captain was a part
of it, a stout, heavy, dark&ndash;bearded man.</p>

<p>“You all here?” asked Keeper Barney.</p>

<p>“All that started,” replied the captain. “Two
men&mdash;they were passengers&mdash;left on a life&ndash;savin’
mattress. We told ’em to wait any way till
daylight, but they said the tide was right and
would drift ’em ashore and they’d risk it. They
was fearful skittish lest the vessel might break
up. Massy! The sea gobbled ’em up less than
no time, is my ’pinion. They left some time
ago.”</p>

<p>“Well, boys, I’ll have the beach patrolled, of
course, and something may be seen of the men.
Those whose watch it is are off already, and
the rest of you pack up what things are here,
and go back to the station, and Cook Charlie
will have a hot breakfast ready for the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
from the wreck, and for the rest too, soon as
possible.”</p>

<p>While hot coffee and dry clothes were making
every one comfortable at the station, it was
Tom Walker, one of the surfmen out patrolling,
that hurried into the living&ndash;room, startling the
station crew with the announcement, “There’s a
man in the Chair!”</p>

<p>If a rocket from some wreck at sea had come
up through the floor of the station and made its
hideous, fiery racket in the very midst of the
station crew, a greater excitement could not
have followed. Clinging to the jagged rocks
at the Crescent, was some poor soul thrown up
by the sea, piteously looking in helpless appeal
to the houses not so very far away and yet separated
from him by a channel of foaming wrath!
Every surfman could seem to make out in his
thoughts a pale face frantically appealing to
him through the wild storm, and they began to
dress again for their perilous work.</p>

<p>“Cap’n Barney,” said Tom Walker to the
keeper, “if I may suggest it, I think we might
get somewhere near him with our surf&ndash;boat.
We couldn’t have touched the wreck, and can’t
now, out there on Split Ledge, but we might get
our boat up to the village and then launch
her in the river, and so work her down toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the Chair. The tide has turned, and every moment,
there is less water ’tween the Crescent and
the shore, and that will help us.”</p>

<p>“Good idea, Tom,” replied the keeper. “And
instead of getting horses, as it will take so much
time, there are so many of us here and all will
take hold, we can make better time to haul the
boat&ndash;carriage ourselves. What say? It is a
man’s life at stake.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye!” was the deep, hearty chorus in
response from all.</p>

<p>As the boat made its appearance in the village
volunteers appeared also, who dragged
heartily on the ropes of the carriage. It was a
strange sight in the little village, that stormy
morning, the lengthening file of rough, strong&ndash;handed
men pulling on the rope of the carriage
while the boys shouted away and thrust in their
small hands wherever any chance for grasping
the rope showed itself, and some of the women
that came out hurriedly from their homes, their
shawls pinned over their heads, also joined the
procession. The water was reached and the
boat launched.</p>

<p>When, manned by a stalwart crew,&mdash;volunteers
from The Harbor taking the place of the
absent patrols,&mdash;the boat moved off into the
river, cheers arose from those on shore. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
what about the man all this time in the Chair?
Did he see the boat coming, and did he cheer
also?</p>

<p>“Can you see him now?” eagerly asked the
men of Keeper Barney, who was skillfully managing
his steering oar amid the heavy swash of
the current.</p>

<p>The keeper nodded his head in assent.</p>

<p>The boat cleared the last house in the village,
and from this point the Chair could be more
distinctly seen.</p>

<p>“See him now, Cap’n?”</p>

<p>The keeper nodded his head. The boat tossed
more uneasily now, for the harbor here began to
open into the sea, and the full strength of the
wind from the stormy north&ndash;east smote it. The
upper end of the Crescent was very near, and
its first ledges, black and stubborn, rose out of
the white, angry tumult. Any one seeking
refuge here would not have found broad standing
room, while at the Chair the exposure was
far greater. The man, though, still maintained
his hold.</p>

<p>“He’s there, is he?” some one would shout
through the noise of the storm, and Keeper Barney
would silently nod assent.</p>

<p>I wonder what the man in the Chair was
thinking of, as he grasped that rocky projection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
that little low fence between him and death!
He was one of the two men who had trusted
their chances to that life&ndash;preserver. God alone
knew where the second man was in this hellish
tumult of wind and sea. The man in the Chair
had been flung into it by a violent wave and he
had gripped it with all the energy he could possibly
rally. He did not want to die. The sea
looked cold and deep, and the white foam beating
upon him, to his imagination had teeth that
threatened to fasten into him and tear him. He
could sometimes, when his back was half turned
to the sea, catch the outlines of the big billows as
they rolled up and rolled toward him, and they
came on with such fury that he shrank closer to
this rock, and he clung more tenaciously even
when some of them failed to reach him. Occasionally
a huge billow would strike him and
drench him, and then he would shiver and throw
off the foam as if trying to recover from some
murderous blow given by an animal. It would
have been easy to have yielded to one of those
waves and allowed it to sweep him away into a
swift death, but who does not cling to life? A
wild sky, a pitiless rain, and only a black rock in
a maelstrom&mdash;better this than a grave in that
maelstrom. So the man felt. As he held on, his
thoughts would go back in spite of him. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
that he cared to think. He would gladly have
given the subject a grave in that sea from which
he shrank, but if he had tried to throw it off and
drop it there, it would have had a resurrection
and come up. He thought of the time when he
was a little boy in this very neighborhood, visiting
here, one far off summer. His younger sister
was with him. He could easily recall her
blue eyes that framed a constant smile. He
heard the happy ring of her laugh, even out
there in the noisy waters. He did not want to
hear it, but hear it he did. There had been a
quarrel with her one day, and he resolved in a
mood of anger that was almost insane, to punish
her. The quarrel had occurred at the Chair
which he knew sometimes was a bad place to be
in, the older people had told him. When the tide
was high, and behind it was a storm pushing
violently the waters landward, that lonely piece
of rock, the Chair, was a dangerous position to
occupy. There was a gray, misty sky that
day, when the boy led his sister, at low tide,
across the sands to the Crescent ledges. He
pleasantly told her to stay at the Chair and he
would come for her in a little while. “The
waves were pretty,” he said, “and she could
watch them till he came back.” Then he left
her. In half an hour he knew the tide would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
flood the sands and isolate the Chair. He would
be absent, he said to himself, perhaps two hours.
That would give her a good fright and would
be enough to satisfy him. But he did not get
back to the shore so soon as two hours. Something
had detained him. In the meantime, the
fog came on. The rain began to beat down.
The men were almost all of them away on fishing
cruises. Only a few decrepit fishermen
were at home, and they did not like to venture
off into the uneasy waters now enclosing the
Crescent ledges unless it was some special reason
urging them, and as the boy was ashamed
to confess that he had left his sister at the Chair,
no rough but friendly hand of any seaman was
reached out to grasp her. In the morning
though, his conscience frightened him into an
explanation of his urgency, and a relief party of
old men went at once. The Chair however was
empty. That morning, there came ashore a
sweet little face with closed eyes, and it confirmed
the story told by that vacant Chair. So
many, many years ago, did this all happen,
and now it was coming back as a sad thing of
yesterday.</p>

<p>“She’s a&ndash;lookin’ at me!” said the man in the
Chair. “I can see her eyes!”</p>

<p>Yes, through the veil of the storm they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
seemed to penetrate and reproachfully search
his heart.</p>

<p>“I will look another way,” he thought, but
they seemed to follow him. Tender and full of
sorrow, they looked at him on every side. He
saw the waves rushing at him and he shrank
from them only to meet the eyes that he little
cared to behold. He avoided these, but there
were the billows rushing at him again. So he
was pursued. It seemed to him as if he must
lose his mind, and then would he not lose his
hold on the rock? That tormented him anew.</p>

<p>But&mdash;but&mdash;look! Amid the ragged mass
of flying foam jutting above the walls of the
angrily rising waves, he saw a boat! Yes, he
could make out the heads of the men that were
rowing! They were coming to rescue him! He
had enemies on shore who would seize him and
put him behind stone walls, and these men in
the boat might hand him over to those enemies,
but no matter, he would be rescued from the
place of torment he was in. Anything to be
saved from that, and those men would save
him! The rush of exultant feeling was so great
that it affected him even as a wave threatening
to carry him away, but he tightened his
loosened grasp and looked up again. Yes, they
were coming nearer. He could see them, count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
them,&mdash;one, two, three, four, five, six, besides
the man steering. And they saw him! Yes,
they all saw him. To reach him, the boat
slightly changed its course, and now all the
crew looking sidewise could see this castaway.
It was Walter who recognized him. Raising
his head, straining his vision to catch a fuller
view of the man bending over and half veiled
by the misty spray thrown up above the Chair
there came before Walter once more the form
that he had seen that morning in his uncle’s store
when the note so mysteriously disappeared, that
form which he had seen again when patrolling
the beach off the Crescent, one wild November
day.</p>

<p>“Baggs!” he now shouted to the crew in the
surf&ndash;boat. “It is Baggs!” As by a common
impulse, every man ceased rowing and rested on
his oar, the keeper holding the boat with his
long steering&ndash;oar.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” “That is the man!” “It’s
Baggs!” were the various exclamations that
broke from the crew’s lips.</p>

<p>“He’s waving a hand to us!” said Walter.</p>

<p>“Let him wave and die!” some one exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No, I’d save a dog off in that place!” said
the keeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s so!” replied Walter.</p>

<p>“That’s so!” said several.</p>

<p>It was not so much an expression of opinion
by one man or several, as the voice rather of
that noble spirit which has its embodiment in
our entire Life Saving Service and proves it by
its yearly record.</p>

<p>“Row away, men!” shouted the keeper.
“He’s there! I see him.”</p>

<p>But Baggs changed his position. He knew
that it would be difficult to rescue him even
with that boat, such a raging sea broke all
about the rock to which he clung. The boat must
be held off at a little distance from the ledge and
then a rope thrown to him. He must stand his
chances of grasping this only hope of safety.
The tide had begun to subside, and another part
of the ledge was now jutting above the surf.
Whether he thought he could be rescued better
from this second position and so tried to reach
it, or whether in the increasing nearness of the
rescue&ndash;party he grew careless, and accidentally
slipped out of the Chair and was quickly,
eagerly, seized by a wave and hurried away,
who could say? It was Slim Tarleton who just
before had said to the keeper, “He’s holdin’ on,
Cap’n, ain’t he?” And the keeper nodded yes
with his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is he there now, Cap’n?” asked Seavey Lowd
the next minute. The keeper’s head did not
move&mdash;he only fastened his eyes steadily on the
ledge fringed by the surf, as if trying to determine
a fact with certainty, and then rising in
his seat, said solemnly, “I&mdash;b’lieve&mdash;he’s&mdash;gone!
Yes, gone!”</p>

<p>Gone, and he left no more trace behind than a
leaf falling through the air. Gone into that
whirling, eddying sea, into that deep, dark grave
so long clutching at him, and which now buried
him under its waves forever! The boat could
not possibly reach him. Gone, gone!</p>

<p>“Well, men,” said the keeper to the crew, who
resting on their oars looked with sober faces at
the empty Chair into which the waves now
mockingly flung their spray as its only occupant,
“we might take a turn round and then go
home, but that hunt is all up. Don’t see a sign
of him.”</p>

<p>The bow of the surf&ndash;boat was headed for The
Harbor, after a season of waiting. And strong
arms steadily pulled it home.</p>

<p>That afternoon, the captain of the wrecked vessel
walking on the sands at low tide, reported
at the station that a body had come ashore. “It’s
t’other passenger,” he said, “who came ashore
as I told you. You know two started on a life&ndash;savin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>’
thing. It’s ’bout two hundred feet from
here.”</p>

<p>Keeper Barney and Walter followed him to
the designated spot, and there lying on the
beach, his long dark hair hanging in a tangle
over his face as if trying to veil from the world
some dishonored object, was Joe Cardridge.
The body was removed to a shed in a field that
skirted the shore&ndash;rocks. Various articles were
found upon the body, and they were removed
by the keeper for preservation. “What is this?”
asked the keeper, as he took from an inner
pocket of the blouse that Joe had worn, an envelope.
“A letter inside this,” said the keeper,
“and it is directed to me!”</p>

<p>The address was worn and the water had affected
it, and yet the superscription could be
made out.</p>

<p>“A letter for me, brought by a strange
mail&ndash;carrier,” said the keeper. “I will see what
it is.”</p>

<p>“Why,” he exclaimed, “that is a letter from
our district superintendent! Yes, it is the missin’
one that Walter couldn’t find! There is the
date. That clears Walter.”</p>

<p>“I guess he was cleared afore,” declared Tom
Walker, who was present.</p>

<p>Another mystery was solved that day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Many people were attracted to the beach by the
tragedy of the wreck, and among them came
Miss P. Green, Aunt Lydia, and other women.
Some of Joe Cardridge’s family were at the station.
The blouse that he had worn, was drying
before the stove.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” queried Aunt Lydia, who had
come to the station. Her sharp bright eyes
were fastened on a sleeve of the blouse, turned
back at the wrist. “If there ain’t that blue
W that I tucked away in the white linin’ of
Walter’s blouse!”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Tom Walker.</p>

<p>“There!” replied Aunt Lydia. “That is
Walter’s coat, I know.”</p>

<p>“Walter’s coat?” asked Keeper Barney, who
had joined the circle of inspection.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Aunt Lydia, “I sewed a blue
W on to the white linin’ of Walter’s sleeve, and
here it is.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said the keeper. “Joe Cardridge
exchanged blouses with Walter, that is what he
did, and carried off the missin’ letter.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;” said little Charlie Cardridge
who was present, and overhearing the conversation
wished to show that some of the property
in the room did belong to his father, “that’s
father’s. Looks like his, anyway.” He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
pointing at the flask found in Walter’s pocket
and now standing on the sill of a window in
the station. The flask was handed to Charlie.
Turning it over, he exclaimed, “There’s a C!
That is father’s.”</p>

<p>In the bottom of the flask the letter C had
been blown, and it now proved who the real
owner of that mysterious property had been.</p>

<p>“No doubt about it!” declared Tom Walker,
who with others of the crew had come into
the kitchen. “No doubt about it! There was
an exchange of blouses by the owner of the
flask, and the latter was left by Joe as a witness
agin Walter. A pretty deep game! Walter,
give us your hand. I knew before though that
you were all right.”</p>

<p>Tom gripped Walter’s hand as if it were a
pump&ndash;handle on a dry, hot, thirsty day. Others
congratulated Walter, and none more readily
than the keeper.</p>

<p>There was no investigation by the district
superintendent when he arrived, and the news
of the wreck brought him the next day.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="pch">CHRISTMAS.</p>

<p>Uncle Boardman was destined to have a
Christmas present. At least, he began
to think it looked like it, for there behind
the kitchen stove, swinging from the
wooden shelf over the fire&ndash;place, was Uncle
Boardman’s stocking on Christmas morning.
If it were a joke, too bad to send a man
barefoot over the cold floors hunting up his
property. It was an enormous stocking. No
mean, puny leg did Uncle Boardman carry
about, and the stocking corresponded. It was
a blue stocking, and it was thick and warm.
What was a stocking for Uncle Boardman by
day, would have made a good blanket for any
baby by night. Uncle Boardman looked at the
stocking and grinned. “Can’t be anything in
it,” he said. “I thought Lydia and I gave up
such things long ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>But the stocking seemed to say, “Try me and
see what I can do for you.”</p>

<p>“I will,” thought Uncle Boardman. Down
into the stocking he ran a good sized fist, and
fished out a piece of paper neatly folded up.</p>

<p>“One of Lydia’s jokes,” he said. The paper
though was directed to “Boardman Blake.” He
took it to the eastern window, at which the
Christmas sun was hanging an outside curtain
of crimson. He opened the missive and read:</p>


<p class="pbq p1">“<i>Dear Boardman:</i>&mdash;I have been thinking about your mortgage,
and I have concluded to extend it as you wished, and I
know you have had a hard time, and you may have it extended
for one or two years, as you like, and not pay any interest.
With a wish for a Merry Christmas,</p>

<p class="pr6">“Your old friend,</p>
<p class="pr4">John Elliott.”</p>

<p class="p1">Uncle Boardman felt enough like a happy
boy to shout “Hurrah!” and then he skipped upstairs
to execute a dance in his wife’s chamber.</p>

<p>“I thought it would make you happy,” said
Aunt Lydia. “Miss Green was in here last evenin’
and brought it from the office, and so I
tucked it into your stockin’.”</p>

<p>“Well, Lydia, you shall have a new gown
from this, for your present.”</p>

<p>And what was it that moved Capt. Elliott to
make that Christmas present? Could he say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
his prayers with comfort nowadays, and had
he found such peace that he wished to take
peace to another heart?</p>

<p>His grandchild, Amy, was with him one day,
while he was examining the Blake mortgage
and other papers. Looking up, he thought,
“That child is like the Atlantic Ocean.” Like
the Atlantic Ocean! She so little, and that so
vast! It was an absurdity. And yet when one
looked into her eyes, of such deep azure, when
one witnessed the vivacity of her nature, the
play of whose emotions was so varied, restless,
and oftentimes intense, saw too the sparkles
that kept coming and going in the depths of
her eyes, one could but think of that Atlantic
whose blue waves kept coming and going, each
wave a crystal flashing in the sun.</p>

<p>Amy Elliott with a child’s keenness of observation
was watching her grandfather as he handled
a certain document that had been lying beside
his Bible. It was prayer time with him, one
of those seasons when he would try to climb the
stairway of a new and holy life, and somehow
would be baffled and turn back. While reading
his Bible, he chanced to notice a sheet of paper
near it, and his thoughts wandering off to it, he
interrupted his Bible reading long enough to
find out what it was that called off his attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
It was Boardman Blake’s note about the mortgage
on his house, asking that a little indulgence
be granted him. The sight of this irritated the
old man, and he gave vent to his irritation in a
sharp remark to Amy. “There, there, Amy, you
interrupt me! You go and play somewhere.”</p>

<p>The child had not interrupted him, but that
letter disturbed him, and it was convenient to
blame Amy.</p>

<p>“Grandpa reading and praying?” inquired
Amy. “That Grandpa’s prayer to God? Did
God hear?” As she spoke, she laid her tapering
little finger on Boardman’s letter. If she
had struck him a cruel blow, she could not have
wounded him more deeply. He clutched in his
hand the letter, and muttering to himself, rose
and went upstairs to a dark little closet where
he would sometimes shut himself in and pray.
Down he dropped upon his knees. “Grandpa’s
prayer to God!” Supposing it had been his
prayer to God, what would God have done with
it? If it had been John Elliott crying to God
for favor, what would God have done?</p>

<p>“He hasn’t answered me,” murmured the old
man. And then the inquiry arose in his heart,
why God had not answered him?</p>

<p>Somehow there came into his mind with
strange swiftness those old words: “With what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
measure ye meet, it shall be measured to you
again.”</p>

<p>Was not that letter the obstacle on the stairs
of the better life he was trying to climb? Did
he not stumble over it again and again? Would
God extend mercy to him until he had had compassion
on a fellow creature?</p>

<p>“I will!” he sobbed. “I will be merciful. I
will extend the time for the payment of that
note.”</p>

<p>And down into his soul as through some window
opened just above him, streamed the light
of the forgiving presence of God. No obstacle
now on the stairway that John Elliott was trying
to climb!</p>

<p>The first thing he did when he left that place
of prayer, was to take pen and paper. At first
he thought he would simply extend the time
for the payment of that note.</p>

<p>“I can do better than that,” he said, and wrote
the note already given.</p>

<p>To Aunt Lydia, he sent a request that the
note might be handed to her husband, Christmas
day. Aunt Lydia dropped it into that capacious
stocking. There was a happy Christmas
gathering at Boardman Blake’s. Walter’s father
and mother were there, and some of the
neighbors were invited to “drop in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“We must ask the Elliotts,” said Aunt Lydia,
and May, Amy, and Capt. Elliott came to represent
them.</p>

<p>Miss P. Green too had been invited, and with
her appeared her boarder, Chauncy Aldrich.
Walter had faithfully kept his word to
Chauncy, and careful nursing met with its reward.
Back from the gates of death, was
Chauncy brought, and he also came into a new
life, spiritually. He walked after Christ in love
and obedience. He returned after Christmas to
the home of his parents, and he took his Christian
principles with him and steadfastly adhered
to them.</p>

<p>When the lights at the Christmas gathering
had all been extinguished, and Walter was in
his room upstairs, before retiring he looked out
of the window toward the sea. He detected a
bright little light crawling along through the
darkness in the direction of the beach opposite
the Crescent, “That is Tom Walker’s lantern,”
thought Walter. “It is his watch, and he is
out upon his beat.”</p>

<p>The light disappeared behind a projection of
the shore ledges, and then Walter bowed in
prayer and asked God to care for his brave
old comrades who were caring for others and
“<i>Fighting the Sea</i>.”</p>
